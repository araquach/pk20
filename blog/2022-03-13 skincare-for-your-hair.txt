As hairdressers it is extremely important that we believe and trust in the products that we use, and this is why we chose to use the professional haircare brand KEVIN.MURPHY in our salons. 

# What is KEVIN.MURPHY?
The brand was founded by the Australian hairdressing legend himself, Kevin Murphy. He is a master of his craft and is one of the most sought-after stylists. His work has been on all the major magazine covers and in 2007, he was awarded the Australian Masters Award at the AHFAS, for his outstanding contribution to the hairdressing industry. 

Kevin found that the products on the market weren't answering his needs as a stylist, which led him to develop his own brand.   
Known as, “skincare for your hair” the KEVIN.MURPHY products contain the highest quality ingredients. All sourced from organic growing practices, or ecologically sound wild harvesting techniques. This is to ensure the ingredients are of the highest natural quality.

Not only is KEVIN.MURPHY great for maintaining healthy hair but for its contribution to helping the environment and climate change. They create products that do no harm to our environment by utilising packaging that is recyclable or biodegradable. KEVIN.MURPHY only use sulphate free surfactants that effectively cleanse and remove surface oil and dirt, without stripping or depleting the hair of its colour. What more could you want out of a haircare brand!

# What range of products do KEVIN.MURPHY have?
They have a huge variety of products which include:
Shampoos, conditioners, shimmer sprays, leave-in treatments, styling creams, dry shampoos, heat protection products, volume sprays, texturises, root touch ups and much much more! 

# Is Kevin Murphy vegan?
Most of KEVIN.MURPHY's products are vegan, although some do contain milk-protein extracts. Just ask your stylist, which products work best for your hair that are vegan.

# Is Kevin Murphy cruelty-free?
Yes!
Kevin Murphy is completely cruelty-free and PETA certified! 
Not one of their products are tested on animals, and neither are any of the ingredients used in their products. Therefore their products aren't sold in countries where animal testing is required by law. Guilt-free shopping!

# Is Kevin Murphy sulphate-free?
Yes!
Kevin Murphy products are completely free from sulphates, parabens and any other harsh chemicals. The brand uses eco-friendly wild harvesting techniques, micro cultivation and organic growing practices to ensure that the range is as natural as possible.
