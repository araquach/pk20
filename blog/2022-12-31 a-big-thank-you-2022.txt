The end of the year is a natural time for reflection and the teams are so thankful for every single client, message, review and follower. We just couldn't do what we do without you, so here's a big “THANK YOU” for all of your ongoing support and for putting your hair in our hands time and time again!

**As we burst with joy and gratitude we wanted to share a few highlights from the last 12 months...**

We've collectively had 13,800 visits from wonderful clients this year. Paul Kemp 5,500, Jakata 5,300 and our rising star Base with 3000.  We value this so much and put it down to our talented stylists and the relationships they have with each and every one of you! 

Eve and Sophie, two skilled and gifted team members  successfully completed their apprenticeships and are now working wonders in two of our salons. 

We've had Sarah, Jamie, Becky and Lauryn join us over at our training academy where they are already making waves. We're excited to see them grow and showcase more of their creativity over the next year.

Vicky made the move over to our training academy, joining Layla and Jimmy and we now have a training team like no other for budding hairdressers. 

We celebrated Layla and her unique talents at the British Hairdressing Awards, where we saw her work from the Schwarzkopf Professional Inspire Shoot sprawled across the walls of the venue, what an achievement! 

Then finally to top things off, Jakata and Paul Kemp have just been named as, the top two hairdressers in Warrington by Three Best Rated.  Let's hope Jakata stays in the number one spot as we are celebrating 20 years in 2023!

As we say goodbye to 2022 here at the salons, we would like to wish you a very happy, peaceful and prosperous end to the year. 

**Cheers to a fulfilling 2022 and here's to plentiful 2023!**
