As we embark on the promising journey of 2024, it's a time of reflection, renewal, and readiness for new challenges. In the spirit of a new beginning, we recognise the significance of resetting our mindset and reviewing the progress of the previous year, a crucial step in building a resilient and forward-thinking team. 

Our three salons are fortunate to have leaders who prioritise the well-being and growth of our entire team and the  decision to invest in innovative coaching, delivered by **Anna Mosley**, not only showcases our commitment to fostering a culture of continuous improvement it has prompted us to engage in a meaningful reset, acknowledging the importance of understanding where we've been to determine where we want to go.

In the dynamic world of salon management, where trends evolve rapidly, and client expectations continuously shift, the ability to adapt and grow is paramount. The coaching session prompted us to review our progress from the previous year, celebrating victories and learning from challenges. This reflective process has become a cornerstone in our pursuit of excellence, allowing us to build upon our successes and refine our strategies.

Anna's coaching not only emphasised the importance of reviewing our past but also provided us with the tools to unlock **mental fitness**, a key factor in achieving success in our salons. The discussions around imposter syndrome, perfectionism, and the choice between a growth and fixed mindset's laid the groundwork for a transformative experience.

Anna delivered a comprehensive roadmap to mental fitness, comprising six steps that have become the guiding principles for our team:

- Take Responsibility
- Choose Your Focus
- Adopt a Growth Mindset
- Build High Self-Esteem
- Proactively Step Outside Your Comfort Zone
- Process and Praise the Progress

These steps serve as a daily compass, directing our efforts toward personal and professional growth, creating a positive and resilient team ready to tackle the challenges of the salon industry.

In a profession where appearance is paramount, the mental well-being of our team members is often overlooked. Recognising this gap, the coaching session empowered us to take responsibility for our mental fitness, fostering an environment where personal growth is not just encouraged but actively pursued, in order to benefit our clients and our teams.

The impact of this coaching extends beyond our seasoned professionals. Recognising the potential to shape the future of hairstyling, we view this investment as a priceless gift to our apprentices at Base Hairdressing. Equipped with the tools for mental fitness early in their careers, these budding stylists are poised for success in an ever-evolving industry.
