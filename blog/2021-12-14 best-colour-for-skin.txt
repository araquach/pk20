There's no question that your hairstyle is one of the most important parts of how you present yourself to the world. Unlike your clothes, or makeup, you can't just take it off at the end of the day. Therefore, it's important to recognise what suits our natural appearance, but also what reflects our individual personalities. 

The cut you go for is obviously important for achieving a look that compliments your face shape, however, in this blog we're going to uncover how to find the best hair colours to suit your skin tone. Discovering this can transform you from looking dull and washed out, to looking like the glowing goddess you are!

Before even thinking about hair colour we need to start with the skin. Now, when it comes to skin colour, most people can tell whether they're fair, medium, or dark skin tone. However it's not that simple, and there's many more factors that come into play. 

So you have tone, which is how dark or light a colour is, and this is the surface colour of the skin. Underneath the skin there is a subtle hue (the undertone), which is what is going to help determine the right hair colour for you. The surface colour can change like when you get a tan or go a bit paler in the Winter, but the undertone never changes.

# How to determine your skins undertone
The first thing you need to know when learning about the undertone is that there are 3 colours: cool, warm and neutral. 
A cool undertone will have pink and blue in it, and people with this undertone tend to burn easily in the Sun. Warm undertones will have traces of reds and golds, and will typically tan and never burn in the Sun. Now, neutral undertones are an equal mix of cool and warm and typically people with this undertone get darker in the Sun, but can sometimes burn. 

It's not always as simple as just looking at your skin and just knowing what your undertone is. It can take a few of the following steps:

## Veins
This can be one of the easiest ways to determine your undertone. 
Check the colour of your veins on the underside of your wrist and they appear blue or purple then you're most likely to have a cool undertone. If they appear a green colour then you probably have a warm undertone. Those with a neutral undertone may struggle to see their veins as they will blend into your natural skin tone. 

## How does your skin react in the Sun?
Do you burn easily, or do you tan or do you do both? 
If you're one to burn easily, this means you have less melanin in your skin and probably have a cooler undertone. Those with medium to darker skin usually don't burn, as they have more melanin and usually have neutral or warm undertones. 

## Eye Colour
People with warm undertones tend to have shades of brown or hazel eyes. Blue, green and pale brown eyes usually have cooler undertones. Those with neutral skin can have any eye colour, usually mixes of cool and warm. 

## Jewellery 
Your choice in jewellery is another indication of your undertone. Does gold tend to suit you best? Then you're most likely warm toned. If you find yourself going for silver or rose gold more often, then you're probably cooler toned. And you guessed it! Neutral tones look good in either!

Now that we've looked at skin, you're probably thinking well what hair colour do I suit? Firstly, just remember that your skin tone (fair, medium or dark), plays just as an important role in whether a hair colour is going to suit you as undertone.  We're also not saying that you shouldn't wear certain colours, we just want to help guide you in choosing the right shade that's going to enhance your natural features. 

# What hair colour will flatter me?

## Blondes 
**Fair skin** tones with cool undertones, ashy, icy platinum and softer shades of blonde are going to really flatter your fair skin. If you go for warmer coppery shades, this can tend to make your skin look more pink. However, copper, gold and caramel shades of blonde are going to really make those with warm undertones skin glow. 

**Medium skin** tones with cool undertones or warm undertones, both really suit sandy, beige blondes. Basically, a nice mixture of brown and blonde tones and add in some honey shades for warm undertones. Those with olive skin (neutral) look great with shades of caramel. 

Finally, if you have **dark skin** and warm undertones a soft honey blonde with dark roots can look really good. Ashy blondes work well on dark skin with cool undertones.

## Brunettes
There's a shade for everyone when it comes to brunette hair and it involves no bleaching! Brunettes who have **fair skin** with cool undertones are flattered by taupe, neutral or blue-based shades of brown, varying from dark to light. Red tones work best if you have warm undertones, so a rich chocolate brunette colour can look amazing. 

**Medium skin** tones with cool undertones, look great with glossy rich browns, and even with tints of blue or purple added in will compliment their complexion. On the other hand, those with warm undertones should not go for the blueish tint and opt for any warm brown colour, like mahogany. They can even go lighter with almond and honey colours. 

Those with **olive skin** are usually blessed with dark brunette hair, when it comes to dying they can experiment with ashier shades of brown too.

**Darker skinned** beauties are typically born with deep brunette or black hair and blue-black inky tones look great if you have a cool undertone. Warm undertones suit dark hair with tonal highlights of lighter browns and bronzy tones to add more depth.

## Reds
Red hair is actually the most versatile. Great news right?! All you need to do is tailor the shade to your skin tone. Then you’ll have everyone jealous of your hair!

Usually when it comes to red hair and **fair skin** the two go hand in hand. If you have a cool undertone, then adding strawberry tints can bring it to life. Sticking to your natural tones, but adding some light and depth is also very flattering. If you have porcelain skin and are looking to dye your hair red, or already have red hair, then veer towards an auburn colour which is universally flattering. For warm undertones, copper red is great colour to compliment this complexion. 

If you’ve got a **medium skin** tone with cool undertones, a great option for you is a burgundy or purplish-blue red colour. Warmer orange/copper shades will have the tendency to wash you out. The opposite is true for medium skin with warm undertones.

If you're considering going red and have **dark skin** with cool undertones, then a berry shades like a deep purplish-red would look stunning. However with warm undertones, a fiery, bold red is really going to stand out, or if you want something more subtle then go for a colour with a coppery base.  

Medium-toned reds are perfect for you if you have **olive skin**. An auburn shade is perfect.

## Rainbow Colours 
Colours that fall into this category are any that aren't natural. There are obviously millions of other colours ranging from pastels to vibrant colours to neons and it's about finding the right colour combinations to express your individual eccentricity. 

Pastel shades are ideal for those who have fair skin and cool undertones, and especially suit pastel pinks. Colours with blue hues and purples really compliment warm undertones well. 

For those **medium to dark skin**, with warm undertones, pastel colours can also look amazing with an ombre style and natural roots. They also look great with jewel-hued blues and greens. Cool undertones are complimented by vibrant jewel colours like magenta, to bring out the richness of the skin. Deeper skin colours natural radiance will shine through when paired with vivid pinks, purples and blues for cool undertones. Deep plum and ruby are very flattering on warm undertones 

If you have a **neutral undertone** and want to go for crazy colours, then just keep in mind what colours match your surface skin tone best. 

Just to clarify, we are by no means trying to say that if you have a certain skin tone, you can't get certain hair colours! You are beautiful no matter what. We're just here to offer advice to allow you to be the most flattering version of yourself.
