If you've noticed your hair texture has become more dry and brittle, there could be a number of factors that have caused this. Chances are, it didn't just happen overnight and it's most likely a build up of habits/hair care mistakes that you don't even realise is putting your hair under stress. 

# 1. Using Too Much Heat

## Styling
The first cause could be you're using your styling tools with too much heat, or holding the heat on your hair for too long.    So before styling your hair, make sure you're checking the temperature of your styling tools and always remember a heat protectant - the Schwarzkopf Professional, OSiS+ Flatliner Spray is a great one for all hair types. 

## Sun Exposure 
You may think because sun exposure is natural it won't cause damage to your hair, when in fact too much exposure to UVA and UVB rays can be just as harmful as bleach! The Sun weakens the hairs protein structure, sucking out the moisture and making it more susceptible to breakage. Those with colour-treated hair need to be especially careful as the hair will already be weakened and will risk losing pigmentation. 

To combat this, try wrapping a scarf around your hair, wear a wide-brimmed hat or cover yourself with an umbrella when exposed to harsh UV rays. Or, use an SPF product catered to shielding hair against harmful rays.

## Hot Water 
It’s true: a hot shower after a long day can work wonders. But not on your hair! Too much exposure to hot water is very drying and should be avoided. It’s best to wash hair in lukewarm water. If you can handle it, rinse your hair in cold water, which smooths the roughened hair surface.

If your hair is already damaged through being exposed to too much heat, then taking preventative steps like mentioned should help your hair get back to its original, healthy state. Just remember: MOISTURE MOISTURE MOISTURE! Bringing back moisture and hydration to your hair is the key! Try using moisturising/damage repairing shampoo's and conditioners. And don't miss out on your weekly hair mask! 

# 2. You brush your hair too often
Try to avoid brushing your hair too often. This can roughen the surface of the hair, causing friction, damage and loss of moisture. Also make sure  you're using the correct brush for your hair. 

# 3. You wash your hair too often
If your hair is on the dryer side, avoid washing it daily. 
Washing your hair too often strips your hair of the protective oils, so it's best to wash it at least every 2-3 days if absolutely necessary. 

# 4. Using the wrong hair care products
Dry hair is the result of hair which is lacking in moisture and hydration. Ensure you're using products that are designed for dry hair, to restore moisture, smooth and shine.

We stock a couple different ranges of products that are great for replenishing the moisture in your hair, which include:

*  Schwarzkopf Bonacure Moisture Kick - includes shampoo, conditioner, spray conditioner and treatment.
*  KEVIN.MURPHY HYDRATE.ME range 
*  Schwarzkopf Professional - Fibre Clinix Hydrate range 

We also offer an in-salon Fibre Clinix moisture booster treatment that harnesses cutting edge science to repair the hair. So just have a chat with your stylist if this is something you'd be interested in! You can also take the at-home treatment away with you to use in between services. 

# 6. You are using the wrong styling products
If you have dry hair, it's best to avoid styling products like - strong hold hairspray and dry shampoos. These products soak up excess oils which dry hair needs, which leads to your hair becoming dryer and more dull. You can instead opt for nourishing, light weight hairsprays and dry shampoos designed for dry hair. 

We also stock some awesome styling products which are:

* Schwarzkopf SESSION LABEL - The Miracle 
A multi-tasking styling balm from SESSION LABEL that primes, defines and controls without overburdening. Provides up to 230°C/450°F heat protection for hair - and it's vegan!

* KEVIN.MURPHY SMOOTH.AGAIN 
This anti-frizz leave-in treatment is designed to smooth and soften unruly hair. Combining styling properties with treatment ingredients, it helps to soften and re-hydrate whilst providing heat protection. With consistent use, the hair become shinier, healthier and more manageable.

* KEVIN.MURPHY YOUNG.AGAIN treatment oil leaves hair super nourished and deeply conditioned without being weighed down.  Hair is stronger, smoother, shinier, softer, and rejuvenated.

# 7. You don’t nourish your ends
Split ends are a common problem for dry hair. Most of the oils and moisture in your hair are closer to the scalp, which is why the ends tend to be dryer and more prone to breakage. How do you solve this? Pay attention to the ends! Don't forget to condition the ends of your hair when washing, and remember to use intensive masks and oils to damage repair damage and lock in moisture!

# 8. Swimming in chlorine or salt water 
Frequent swimming in chlorine water or salt water is never great for obtaining healthy hair. The chemicals in swimming pools and salty sea water, strip the hair of its natural oils, leading to dull, lifeless hair, which no one wants! But there are ways to combat this so don't cancel your holiday too soon - just make sure to rinse your hair with fresh water, before and after going in the pool or the sea. And, remember your intensive treatment mask, or conditioner to replenish your hair. 

If you use the swimming pool regularly, a great product to try before a moisturising shampoo, is the Schwarzkopf Professional Clean Balance Shampoo, to remove the chlorine. Or, the KEVIN.MURPHY MAXI.WASH, which is designed to get rid of un-wanted product build up. Great as a pre-colour treatment shampoo too!

# 9. Your scalp isn't making enough oil needed to keep your hair moisturised
Your hair can't moisturise itself, and relies on the natural oils from your scalp for this. But when your scalp isn't producing enough oil, this leads to dry hair - the opposite to greasy hair. As you get older, your hair naturally becomes dryer, as less oil is produced, so it can just be a part of getting older. 

If you are worried that you might be using the wrong products for your hair, have a chat with one of our expert stylists and they will recommend the best products for your hair. 

During your appointment, we will take all the appropriate steps to ensuring the moisture is brought back into your hair.
