Completing your first year of an apprenticeship is a great achievement. You have successfully thrown yourself into something completely unknown and you are around half of the way through completing your Level 2 Hairdressing qualification. This blog post will explain all that I have learnt at PK Hairdressing's sister salon and expert training academy, Base Hairdressing and what you can expect to learn after you finish your first year. 

First of all, I have learnt a completely new skills set in an area that I had no prior experience of previously. This in itself is a vast amount of information to take on board but, if I was to summarise Base Hairdressing with one word it would be 'supportive' so it's felt almost effortless! 

Some of the key skills I have now mastered are:

- the importance of client care
- consultation skills
- root and all over colour application
- highlighting techniques for both 1/2 a head and a full head
- basic cutting such as one length layers and fringes
- hair up and styling techniques

I have received this in depth training and education from our two educators Vikki our Head of Training and Layla our Salon Manager & Head of Education.  They have both been fantastic, Vikki has been the industry for 15 years and Layla 7 years. Both of them have had year long advanced colour training so I'm so lucky to be coached and guided by them. 

Layla in particular really boosts my confidence and believes in me. I'd say she's really helped me to embrace my creative side and enhance my skills without worrying. I've become more confident with myself, how I act and how I interact with the people around me, both clients and colleagues. I now have my very own client database and I get to experiment, confident in knowing that I always have Vikki and Layla close by to help and advise.  

One of the most memorable days was when I got to showcase all of what I have learnt by taking part in our very own Base Hairdressing photoshoot. With the guidance of our educators I was able to create a moodboard and plan the entire look from head to toe. This included colouring, cutting and styling the hair, pulling together the outfit and setting the direction for the make up. It was so much fun and the whole team had a blast!

The team are one of my favourite things about starting my apprenticeship at the Base Training Academy. I have met so many lovely people, colleagues, clients and other educators from the likes of GHD and Schwarzkopf. I even got to go to the GHD underground event which is an event held by GHD where they showcase their styling tools. They have their educators perform demo's of the tools on models so we can learn all the styling tricks.  I even got to model and be part of the tutorial for the GHD curve thin curl wand.

The people and the social element is definitely one of the reasons why I would recommend Base Hairdressing Academy to other creatives looking to start an apprenticeship.  We also get to work in the sister salons Paul Kemp Hairdressing and Jakata which is great because it means we get to know everyone and absorb even more knowledge from so many talented stylists. All the staff combined even trekked up Snowdon together to raise money for a very special cause.

I absolutely love the team here, the atmosphere is electric and it's such a good place to learn if you are the type of person that likes to get stuck in. It's a creative and fun environment and not only will you learn how to confidently become a hair stylist you will also learn about yourself and the person you want to become!
