They say time flies when you're having fun! It certainly doesn't feel like ten years have past since we first opened the PK doors! 

The salon launched back in July 2011 as an off-shoot from sister salon Jakata, with half of the Jakata team splitting off to set on their new adventure. It was a risky move and an unusual transition but soon PK became one of Warrington's most well known hair brands.

Over the 10 years we've introduced plenty of new faces and we still have some die hard team members too! Our current team are all incredibly talented stylists. Along with creating fashion forward, tailored looks they also ensure a warm, friendly welcome to every client. 

To celebrate our ten years we decided to throw a party. We had the current PK team along with some of the OG crew and Jakata and Base joined in the fun too.

Hideout on Sankey Street was the perfect venue for us to let our hair down and Louies Pizza provided the pizza's and fries.

It was an amazing day and awesome to have a long overdue blow-out with the teams.
