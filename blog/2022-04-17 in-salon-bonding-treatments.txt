Do you ever worry about damaging your hair when you have it coloured? Well, bleach damages the polypeptide chains (bonds) within the inner structure of hair strands, causing the hair to become dry and brittle. This is why we have chosen to offer our clients an array of treatments to add to their colour service to bring back the look and feel of healthy hair. 

These include: 
- K18
- Olaplex
- Fibreplex

**If you're having an in-salon colour service, one of the following treatments is a must to maintain your hair condition! Speak to your stylist to determine the best one for you and read on to learn more about each treatment:**  

# K18
K18 is the latest and greatest breakthrough in bioscience - the K18 molecule works by repairing broken keratin chains, which are the building blocks of hair. Restores strength, softness, smoothness and bounce, bringing your hair back to life on a molecular level and doesn't just wash away. 

The first part of the 2-step treatment process is the K18 Professional Mist, engineered to make hair strong enough to withstand damage that occurs during a bleach, colour or chemical service. The hair must be dusted with water before application and then once the product has been applied, your stylist will wait for 4 minutes before continuing your chemical process. Because it has such a short processing time, it is an extremely time and cost effective product - cutting the time of your colour service by at least 15 minutes compared to other products.

The second step is the Professional Mask. This was engineered to repair damaged caused during the chemical service. It is a leave-in treatment which helps to close the cuticle and seal in the peptide to reconnect the keratin chains. Hair is left smooth and soft with the extra light-weight conditioning benefits. 

The cost to have this in-salon treatment alongside your colour service is £15. To maintain the benefits at home we have 3 take home product sizes: a 5ml size for one use, a 15ml 3 use size which will restore your hair to perfection and a 50ml size for K18 die-hard fans! All to use in between salon visits. It's vegan, cruelty-free and suitable for all hair types, therefore a great all-round product.

# Olaplex
If you're looking to minimise damage during your next colour service we also recommend having our OLAPLEX treatment addition.
You've probably heard of OLAPLEX and how great their at-home products are, however the in-salon treatment is one of the most intense bond-building treatments available. This doesn't mean to say this treatment replaces your at-home routine, it just elevates the benefits. When applied by a professional, the formula can penetrate deeper into the hair follicle to repair damage caused by heat, chemicals and colour. Whether your hair is healthy or not, it will be largely benefit from this treatment - it is free of silicones, oils, aldehydes and parabens, which leave the hair feeling healthier, stronger and shinier hair.

If you’re not an in-salon regular for chemical services, The Stand-Alone Treatment is the perfect treatment to get your routine started. The Stand-Alone is composed of OLAPLEX Nº.1 and OLAPLEX Nº.2 and is the patented OLAPLEX concentrate, also known by OLAPLEX-lovers as ‘liquid gold’. Nº.1 is formulated in every OLAPLEX product, making the in-salon concentrate an extra special treat and boost. The stand-alone treatment will cost you just £25!

If you are someone who gets their hair bleached/coloured regularly then we will add OLAPLEX Nº.1 into the colour to prevent the bleach from damaging your hair. Olaplex with a colour service is £20 - a small price to pay to keep your hair in perfect condition!

We also stock the full range of Olaplex retail products.

## Fibreplex
Fibreplex is Schwarzkopf Professional's first bond enforcing treatment that we also offer our clients who are having a colour service, without compromising the colour result. It's a salon exclusive treatment, therefore you can't this one home. However it's only an additional £5 on top of your regular colour service ,so doesn't break the bank.

## What it does
It protects the hair from damage during the colouration process by interlinking with the hair fibre to enforce strong structural bonds. Fibreplex No. 1 BOND BOOSTER is added straight into the lightening, lifting  or colouring system to give the hair long-lasting colour and protection. Minimising breakage by up to 94%! This is thanks to the Fibre Bond Technology sealing the strands, making them stronger, shinier and healthier. 

If you are having your colour done at any of our salons, you will have one of these treatments incorporated into your colour process, and the additional cost of the treatment will be included in the overall price.
