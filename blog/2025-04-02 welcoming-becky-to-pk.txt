Hairdressing is more than just a profession, it's an art form, a way to bring confidence and self-expression to life. Each cut, colour, and style is a chance to transform, inspire and create something unique. For those with the passion and dedication to master the craft, the journey is as rewarding as the final result.

Here we have Becky and Daisy, two remarkable individuals who have flourished at our training academy, Base Hairdressing. Now, they're ready to take the next step in their careers, moving on from Base to their new homes. Becky with us here at Paul Kemp Hairdressing and Daisy at Jakata Salon. With their talent, creativity and passion for hair, they're set to bring fresh energy and expertise to their clients.

At Base, under the expert guidance of Layla and Vikki, Head of Education and Head of Training, Becky and Daisy underwent rigorous training that moulded them into the stylists they are today. Their journey was marked by countless hours of practice, learning the latest techniques and mastering the art of exceptional customer service. But beyond the technical skills, what truly sets Becky and Daisy apart is their unwavering dedication and their infectious personalities that light up the salon floor.

**Becky** is a passionate stylist with a love for transformation, both in hairdressing and in her personal life. Before discovering her calling in hair, she studied forensic science at John Moores University, but lockdown led her to pursue what truly made her happy. Alongside her career, she has a deep love for horses, spending much of her time with her two equine companions, Tali and Sunni. Specialising in blondes, balayage, and vivid colours, Becky thrives on helping clients achieve looks they love while ensuring they feel confident styling their hair at home. With a keen eye for creativity and a warm, bubbly personality, she’s set to bring her skills and enthusiasm to Paul Kemp Salon.

**Daisy** has always had a deep rooted passion for hairdressing, though it took time for her to fully embrace it. After initially pursuing a different path at college, she realised during lockdown that hair was her true calling. Now, she’s thriving in the salon environment, bringing her creativity and precision to every client she works with. As a mirror twin, Daisy has a unique perspective on individuality and self-expression, which translates beautifully into her hairstyling. She is dedicated to making clients fall in love with their hair, combining technical expertise with a warm, thoughtful approach. When she’s not in the salon, she enjoys spending time with her family, taking long walks with her dog Franklin, and getting lost in a good book. Now stepping into her new role at Jakata Salon, Daisy is excited to continue growing and delivering stunning transformations for her clients.

Now, as Becky and Daisy make the leap from Base Hairdressing Becky to Paul Kemp and Daisy to Jakata, their journey continues with new challenges and opportunities for growth. But they are not strangers to their new salons, having trained and worked onsite during their apprenticeship. They are well versed in providing exceptional customer care and ensuring a delightful experience for every client. And with an irresistible offer of 25% OFF for any new clients, Becky and Daisy are ready to make their mark, showcasing their unique talents and shining personalities.

We extend our congratulations on how far they've come and the bright future that lies ahead. As they embark on this new chapter of their career, we have no doubt that they will continue to inspire and delight clients with their exceptional skills and unwavering passion for hairdressing. While their energy will be missed at Base, their departure opens up spaces for fresh faces to start their journey in the world of hair.

**So whether you're in need of a stylish hair transformation or simply craving some good vibes, Becky and Daisy are ready to welcome you with open arms at their new salons!**
