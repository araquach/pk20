As we all know, continuously dyeing and using heat on your hair can cause it go dry and frizzy, resulting in breakage and damaged ends. If this sounds like your hair then fortunately there is a solution! Olaplex brings to you an in-salon treatment that you can use in the comfort of your home. 

# WHAT IS OLAPLEX?

Olaplex is miracle formula that works to repair all types of hair damage. From high levels of heat from hair dryers, curling irons and hair straighteners to chemical factors such as colours, perms, relaxers and keratin treatments. It can repair hair that has been damaged from brushing and tugging or hair exposed to too much UV rays and cold weather conditions. 

# WHO IS OLAPLEX FOR?

It is beneficial for all hair types, if your hair has been chemically treated, you have virgin hair, whether your hair is curly, or straight. 

For naturally textured and curly hair, Olaplex will improve moisture retention in curls, making them more glossy, bouncy and  will help them to retain their shape. 

For straight hair, it will improve the movement, strength and shine. If Olaplex is used prior to thermal styling, the condition of the hair won't be compromised, therefore you are protected from future damage. 

For extensions, it is recommended by experts to only use Olaplex on 100% human hair. There can sometimes be a Keratin coating which can act as a barrier to Olaplex, if used on extensions that aren't completely human hair. 

# THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT

Olaplex is essentially a bond builder working at a molecular level. All hair contains millions of disulphide bonds that give the hair its structure, strength and stability. When disulphide bonds are broken, they turn into single sulphur hydrogen bonds. When this happens, there are two reactions which follow. One is, the sulphur hydrogen bond pairs with a single oxygen molecule, leading to no further damage. 

The second reaction is where damage can occur. The single sulphur hydrogen molecule will pair with 3 oxygen molecules, creating Cystic Acid. This acid eats the protein out of the hair. Olaplex basically works by pairing with the single sulphur hydrogen bond before the oxygen molecules can. Clever right?
