If you’re thinking of a new hair colour as we come out of lockdown, we would like to highlight the importance of the Allergy Alert Test (AAT).

Allergies to hair colour products are very rare but in extreme cases can be lethal. A simple patch test will determine wether  it's safe to go ahead with your colour service.

If you've had a hair colour service with us within the last six months you probably won't need a re-test. To be sure, use our simple questionnaire below to determine if you need one. If any of your circumstances have changed since your last visit; for example, you used a home hair colorant during lockdown, or you experienced an allergic reaction to something since your last visit, you will need to have the AAT redone.

If you've never had a colour with us before or it's been over 6 months since your last colour service, you are required to have an Allergy Alert Test at least 48hrs before we can colour your hair.

If in any doubt pop in for one 48hrs before your colour service.

# Hair Dyes and COVID-19

You may have seen some reports on social media suggesting that people who have had COVID-19 may have become more sensitive to hair dyes.  Currently, there simply isn’t enough scientific information available to know whether COVID-19 affects the body’s allergic response to substances, such as those used in hair dyes.  It is impossible to know for sure whether any new allergies are due to a change in the body’s immune response due to COVID-19, or because a new allergy developed during a previous hair colouring procedure.

**If in Doubt, be Safe and have an Allergy Alert Test before your colour service.**
