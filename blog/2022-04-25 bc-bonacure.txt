Schwarzkopf Professional are moving towards changing their brand for the better and making it as sustainable as possible. Their most recent change has been their rebrand of the bc Bonacure range, which has embraced the concept of *clean beauty*, without compromising their high-performance ingredients. 

A holistic approach is used from the packaging and formulas to their production sites, because the goal is by 2025 for all the Bonacure production to use a minimum of 50% green energy. By 2030 to strive for 100% of the electricity they source for production, to come from renewable energy and become completely climate positive by the end of the decade. The packaging is made up of 97% recycled plastic and is fully recyclable, so no need to be concerned of what will happen to your product once finished with. 

# Vegan Care Complex

All of the new Bonacure Clean Performance products contain 100% vegan, professional formulas and they do not test them on animals. The products contain Schwarzkopf Professionalâ€™s first Vegan Keratin. This is a vegetable alternative to the classical non-vegan hydrolysed Keratin and is composed of Wheat Amino acids and Soy Amino acids, as well as Arginine HCL and Serine (basically the building blocks of hair). 
The benefits of this new formula are:
- improves strength and elasticity
- reduces static frizz (hair is easier to style)
- restores the natural protective shield of healthy hair
- fully replenishes damaged hair cells
- rebuilds the structure of the hair

The range consists of Repair Rescue, Moisture Kick, Colour Freeze, Time Restore, Volume Boost and Clean Balance, all of which include the Vegan Care Complex. 

Also, did you know that that new conditioners require 50% less water for rinsing, as the new emulsifier combination is highly soluble in water! And don't worry, the quality is still preserved.

This is the direction all haircare brands should be moving towards and we love that we get to work with a brand that not only creates top of the range products, but empowers hairdressers and consumers to create a better future for our planet. 

**If you would like to purchase any of these products in the bc range, they are all available in Salon.**
