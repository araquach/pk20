Hey, I'm Eve, a 22-year-old now Advanced Stylist with a passion for hair and makeup that started at a young age. Before stepping into the world of hairdressing, I was deeply involved in makeup from ages 15 to 18. I was always the kid playing with friends' hair at school, a hobby that turned into a career when I began my apprenticeship at Base. Today, I'm excited to share my journey from an eager apprentice to a fully fledged hair stylist at Paul Kemp Hairdressing.

When I first started my apprenticeship at Base, I was incredibly nervous. It was a completely different experience from my previous jobs at a Chinese restaurant and M&S. Originally, I was set to attend university for property development, but after finishing college during the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to take a leap into hairdressing. It was a big change, a decision I’ve never regretted and it's now been nearly 4 years with the company.

# Early Days in the Salon

The salon environment was unlike anything I could imagine, to be honest, I wasn’t sure what to expect! Working in a premium salon group like ours came with high standards, and learning on the job was both exhilarating and intimidating. One of my biggest challenges was building confidence, especially with tasks like shampooing and head massages. I often worried I was hurting clients when, in reality, I was barely touching them! Another challenge was trusting my instincts with colour choices, which often led to me second guessing myself and seeking reassurance from more experienced colleagues.

One particularly memorable moment during my apprenticeship was the **Base photoshoot** in April 2022. It was a transformative experience that showed me the vast opportunities within the hairdressing industry beyond the salon chair. I was involved in styling the models, working closely with the team to bring our creative vision to life. It was exhilarating to see our ideas take shape and to be part of a project that showcased the artistry and creativity of hairdressing.

Since then, I've had the incredible opportunity to attend a **Hooker & Young** education day run by **Schwarzkopf**. There, I styled the hair of a professional model, an experience that pushed my skills and creativity to new heights. The images from this day are part of a top secret project for the salon's new branding, set to launch in 2025. While I can't share the photos yet, I'm thrilled to see how they will contribute to our salon's fresh, innovative image. This experience has further fuelled my passion for exploring different facets of the hairdressing industry, beyond working behind the chair.

The training process at **Base** was just right, striking a perfect balance between guidance and independence. I appreciated that small mistakes were sometimes allowed, as they were invaluable learning opportunities. While I found colour work came naturally to me, cutting was more challenging and required more practice and patience.

The most valuable lesson I learned during my apprenticeship was the importance of clients. The clients who trusted me in my early days, when I was still learning, were instrumental in my growth, and many of them still come to me today.

When I was offered the opportunity to work on site at **Paul Kemp Hairdressing**, I felt both excited and nervous. It was a significant step in my career 'SH*T JUST GOT REAL!' Moving to PK meant stepping out of the comfort zone provided by the educators at Base, but it also offered immense growth opportunities. One of the great things about our training is that, as apprentices at **Base**, we get the chance to work on site at PK and Jakata on some days, supporting the stylists. This experience allows us to immerse ourselves in a busy and real salon environment, learning the ropes and mastering the basics in a hands on way.

The environment and clientele at **Paul Kemp Hairdressing** were slightly different, but having already known the team made the transition smoother. I had dreamed of working at Paul Kemp throughout my apprenticeship, and joining the team felt like a perfect fit. It was a fantastic opportunity to grow and refine my skills, surrounded by talented colleagues who supported and inspired me.

# Becoming a Fully-Fledged Stylist

There wasn’t a single moment when I felt I had transitioned from an apprentice to a stylist, it was a gradual process. My apprenticeship flew by, and before I knew it, I was fully immersed in my work, enjoying the creative freedom it offered. Taking on my first client as a stylist was nerve wracking but thrilling. I was eager to put my skills to the test and continue learning.

For those just starting their journey in hairdressing, my advice is simple. **'Just do it!'** There's a stigma around the hairdressing industry that I'm passionate about breaking. Many people mistakenly view hairdressing as a low skill, low reward profession, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The industry is full of opportunities for creativity, professional growth, and financial rewards.

One of the key aspects of growing in this field is retail. I love prescribing professional hair care products to my clients and sharing insider knowledge on how to care for, maintain, and properly style their hair at home. It's not just about selling products, it's about ensuring that clients can maintain the health, integrity, and confidence in their hair between appointments. This personalised advice helps them achieve salon quality results on their own, and it builds trust and loyalty, which can translate into additional income for the stylist.

Referrals are another excellent way to grow your clientele and keep your schedule full. Our referral program offers a great incentive, when you refer a friend, both you and your friend receive **£20 off your next appointment**. It's a fantastic way to reward our clients for spreading the word and helps bring new faces into the salon.

Social media also presents significant opportunities. By showcasing your work on platforms like **Instagram** or **TikTok**, you can attract a broader audience and potential new clients. It's a powerful tool for building your brand, sharing your skills, and connecting with other professionals in the industry. Additionally, participating in photoshoots and other creative projects can further boost your profile and open up even more opportunities.

Looking back, the most crucial factor in my growth so far as a hairstylist was putting myself out there. Many of my early clients found me through online groups, and many of them still trust me with their hair today. As for the future, I’m eager to explore opportunities beyond the salon chair, such as getting involved in education and more photoshoots.

Excitingly, I’ve recently started helping train apprentices at **Base**, joining the wider training team. It’s an amazing opportunity to give back and share what I’ve learned with those just starting their journey. I even led my first training session, titled **'Blonde it B!tch, Lived in Luxury'** where I focused on advanced techniques for creating natural, lived in blonde looks. This experience has sparked a new passion for mentoring, and I can’t wait to do more.

Ultimately, hairdressing is a versatile and dynamic career with many paths to success. By putting yourself out there, embracing every learning opportunity, and exploring various income streams, you can build a rewarding and prosperous career in this industry. I am committed to breaking the stigma surrounding hairdressing and exploring how far this career can take me. My journey from apprentice to Advanced Stylist has been filled with learning, growth, and unforgettable experiences. I'm grateful to work at **Paul Kemp Hairdressing** and to have trained at **Base Hairdressing**, with both salons playing pivotal roles in shaping my career. 

***I'm excited about what the future holds and can't wait to continue growing as a stylist and now as a mentor in this dynamic industry.***
