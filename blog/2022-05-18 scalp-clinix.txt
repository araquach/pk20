# What is Scalp Clinix?
Do you find that your scalp can get either irritated, itchy, dry or oily too often? If you can relate to any of these, then Schwarzkopf Professional's Scalp Clinix range might be the one for you! It's a customisable scalp care regime which helps to re-balance the scalp's microbiome, restoring the scalp to it's original healthy state. 

# Why Scalp Health Is So Important?
We believe taking care of your scalp should be just as important as taking care of your skin. After all, they are connected! Just like skin, your scalp has different needs it requires to stay healthy. If you aren't catering for those needs, you may find issues like Dandruff, Dermatitis and Sebum over-production might occur. When your scalp's microbiome is out of balance it isn't just your scalp that's affected, but your hair too - a scalp that produces too much oil can be a result of dry scalp. I know confusing right? When your scalp is dry it will overcompensate and produce too much oil, leading to greasy hair with drier ends. This is why we equip all our stylists with the knowledge of scalp care and how important it is, to help resolve any clients concerns.

# The Scalp Clinix Range
With people's awareness of scalp conditions growing, Schwarzkopf Professional developed Scalp Clinix as an Extension of the Fibre Clinix range. This is so hairdressers would be able to offer a customisable in-salon service for hair and the scalp, that can be maintained with a home maintenance regime. 

# In-salon Service
## - Scalp Clinix Biotic Service
This is exclusively an in-salon treatment, dedicated to caring for your scalp. It helps to support the scalp's microbiome balance for improved scalp condition, soothes and calms the scalp, and leaves the scalp with a moisturised and balanced feeling. Combined with specific skincare inspired ingredients and formulated with Microbiome Active Technology it is the perfect treatment to achieve beautiful, healthy hair. 

There are three steps to this 15 minute service, once your stylist has diagnosed your scalps needs. 

The first is...
