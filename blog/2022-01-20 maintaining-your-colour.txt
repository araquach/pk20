Have you ever left the salon and can't stop looking at/touching your hair because you love it so much? Wouldn't it be great if you could make that feeling last as long as possible! Taking care of your colour-treated hair after visiting the salon is vital for maintaining colour vibrance and healthy locks. We've put together a few simple ways you can keep your colour for as long as possible.

## Reduce the heat
If you want to hold on to your colour for longer, one thing you can try is washing your hair with cool water. This is because hot water opens up the cuticle, allowing the colour to wash out. Washing your hair less often (2-3 times per week) can also reduce colour fade. We get nothing beats a hot shower, so just turn the temperature down a notch when you shampoo and condition and you will reap the benefits. 

The same applies when it comes to heat-styling. Excessive heat from hairdryers and straighteners etc, will quickly fade your colour, so turn the heat down on those too. 

Also, never forget heat protection before heat-styling! This is important for overall hair health and will extend the life of your colour. Heat protection sprays will help reduce moisture loss, smooth the appearance of your hair and protect from humidity after heat styling. 

## Invest In A Home-care Regime
If you've just spent your hard-earned cash on getting your hair professionally coloured, it's wise to try and keep your colour for as long as you can. Purchasing professional, high quality products for your hair is another way to make sure the colour is maintained. Cheap, drugstore products usually include lots ingredients prone to strip the hair. 

Here are a few recommendations of products to use for colour-treated hair:

The Schwarzkopf BC Colour Freeze range and Schwarzkopf Fibre Clinix Vibrancy range are designed to minimise colour fade.

For refreshing the *cool blonde* tones at home we have Schwarzkopf's Blonde Me range, the BC Colour Freeze silver shampoo, and the Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel. 

For refreshing more *vibrant* tones we have the CHROMA ID Bonding masks available in a variety of colours and for more specialised refreshing of tones we can tailor make a custom mixed CHROMA ID colour for you to use at home. 

To keep *vibrant* and *pastel* tones looking their best we recommend a colour top-up visit in between main visits to refresh the tone.
