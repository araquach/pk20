Here at PK we love welcoming new clients to the salon along with the exciting prospect of creating an amazing new colour & style for them. Before you make your booking it's worth having a look over these tips to ensure you have the best possible experience. 

With the large number of stylists we have, the complexities of the latest colouring techniques and new skin testing legislations, we've put together this comprehensive list of tips for your first visit...

# Tip 1: Book a consultation in advance

This mainly applies to colour and restyles. Booking a consultation in advance gives you and your new stylist a chance to get to know each other and get an idea of what you are wanting from your appointment. 

In this appointment you will discuss your ideas and visions you have for your hair. You may go through some colour swatches and inspiration pictures. You will also have your patch test done in this appointment (*patch testing is a legal requirement and has to be done at least 48hr before your colour appointment*).

# Tip 2: Inspiration Pictures

Inspiration pictures are a fantastic tool to use when discussing a new colour or cut with your stylist. This gives the stylist a clearer idea of what direction you are wanting to go with your hair and confirms that you are both on the same page and takes away any misunderstandings or miscommunication. 

Please bear in mind that pictures are inspiration and it is unlikely that your hair will turn out exactly like the picture you have brought in. It is important to remember that some pictures will have filters and lighting to enhance colours and textures in the hair and your stylist will be able to see this but will understand the direction you are wanting to go.

# Tip 3: Choose a Stylist

Sometimes going to a new salon can be quite daunting. By choosing the stylist you would like to go with beforehand you have an idea of what experience you are going to have in the salon. 

While all of our stylists are trained to the highest possible standard each stylist has their own specialities and style of hairdressing, we also have different stylists with different experience and the price varies depending on the experience they have. So by choosing a budget you're happy to spend can make finding a stylist suitable for you a bit easier. 

We also have all our stylists on our website and you can read about them and their reviews on the website. Each stylist has their own social media as well (Instagram) so taking the time to look through their before and after pictures is a great way to decide whether their style of hairdressing aligns with your vision.

We also have our **quote generator** where you can experiment with different stylist levels and services until you find a price that's right for you.

# Tip 4: Have a back up plan

When you are coming in wanting a colour correction or a complete restyle, sometimes things don’t work out. Either the hair doesn’t lift, the hair is too fragile or anything else.

It is important to have a “back up plan” in mind. We are very good at our jobs but some colour changes and corrections may take a couple of appointments or your hair is not compatible with that specific colour or style. 

If this does happen and your stylist explains that what you are wanting isn’t achievable by having a back up plan will help you and your stylist come up with an alternative so you are still leaving the salon happy with your new hair style.

# Tip 5: Keep an open mind

The last tip from me is to keep an open mind. Our extremely skilled stylists will recommend different colours and styles that they believe would suit you, your lifestyle and your aesthetic. 

There is no obligation to have these recommendations done, but by keeping an open mind, you may leave with something you never would have usually gone forward with but love even more!
