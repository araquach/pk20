The future of hairdressing starts at Paul Kemp Hairdressing…
We’re so excited to introduce three rising stars in the world of hairdressing, Bonnie, Liv and Emily, who are now officially apprentices through Base Hairdressing Training Academy.

From left to right: **Liv, Emily, Bonnie**

Each of them has already spent time with us during evenings and weekends, supporting our team here at Paul Kemp Hairdressing as part of their pre-apprenticeship journey. They've been getting stuck into real salon life, learning hands-on and building their confidence on the floor.

Now, they’re stepping into full **apprenticeships** and continuing to develop their skills both with us and through expert training at Base HQ. We’re proud to be part of their journey and even more excited to see what’s next.

Here’s a little insight into who they are and what they have been up to, in their own words:

## Emily

*"I've had a passion for hair since I was little, my mum’s a hairdresser and once I started working in a salon myself, I fell in love with it too."*

**Emily** is a natural when it comes to technique and precision.

*"My favourite thing I’ve learned so far is how to do a smooth blow dry, it’s helped me improve my skills massively."*

She’s especially excited to develop her skills in cutting and colouring and has a bold creative side.

*"My dream hair service is creative colour, I love using inspiration to get a bit wild and expressive."*

## Liv

*"I’ve always been interested in hairdressing, but as soon as I started as a Saturday girl I just knew this was what I wanted to do."*

Since joining us, **Liv** has grown so much, not just in skills, but in confidence.

*"I’ve loved learning how to be more confident around clients, it’s helped me outside the salon as well."*

**Liv** is looking forward to learning new techniques and building a client base of her own.

*"One day, I’d love to specialise in blondes, although I also really love the brighter and creative colours!"*

*"Hairdressing has always been a way for me to express myself and I’ve always wanted to help others feel confident in their own hair and look."*

**Bonnie** is passionate, thoughtful and creative, with a real drive to help others feel like the best version of themselves.

*"One of my favourite things I’ve learned so far is mixing and applying colours, it’s fun and satisfying and makes me feel like I’ve played a part in the final transformation."*

She’s looking forward to putting her ideas into practice.

*"I can’t wait to start applying all my training on models and showing what I’ve learned."*

Her goal?

*"To become a blonde specialist, I love the process and I’m really good at understanding what people are looking for."*
