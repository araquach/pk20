Welcoming our new duo, Lily and Jasmine as Apprentices! The atmosphere over at our sister salon Base Hairdressing is buzzing with excitement as two new apprentices, Lily and Jasmine, have joined the team.

Lily's colleagues already describe her as a bundle of energy and passion for her craft. Her enthusiasm is infectious, and she thrives in the company of others. Engaging with clients on a daily basis is one of her favourite aspects of the job, and she excels at making them feel at ease with her confident and talkative nature.

While Lily currently enjoys the therapeutic experience of shampooing, her true passion lies in transforming people's relationship with their hair. She aims to make her clients fall in love with their hair again, and her caring nature is evident in her desire to make them feel happy and confident in their appearance.

Beyond her dedication to hairdressing, Lily also has a deep love for animals and their welfare, which aligns with her caring nature. In her spare time, you'll find her indulging in her love for horse riding and spending quality time with friends.

# Jasmine - The Creative Soul

Jasmine, affectionately known as Jaz in the salon, has been supporting Base Hairdressing for over a year on Saturdays before being appointed as an apprentice. Her journey in the world of hairdressing began at a young age, witnessing incredible transformations in her mother's salon. This early exposure ignited her passion for hair, and now she's eager to unleash her creativity and talent at Base.

Clients and colleagues alike admire Jasmine's caring and joyful nature, which helps create a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere in the salon. Her ability to connect with people on a personal level has earned her trust and recognition, and she takes pride in making her clients feel confident and happy with their new hairstyles.

Jasmine's ultimate goal is to become a fully qualified hairdresser, constantly expanding her skills and knowledge in the field. She aspires to share her expertise with others, contributing to the growth and creativity of the hairdressing industry.

# Together, a Dynamic Team
