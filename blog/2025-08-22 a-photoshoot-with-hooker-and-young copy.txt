Last July, our salon duo David and Eve had the incredible opportunity to attend Session with Hooker and Young: The Essential Hair Photography Workshop in Manchester, hosted at the impressive Five Four Studios.

The two-day event, run in collaboration with Schwarzkopf Professional, offered an authentic taste of what it’s like to work on a high-end fashion shoot. With leading British hairdressing icons Gary Hooker and Michael Young at the helm, the workshop attracted stylists from across the country and gave David and Eve the perfect chance to create new brand imagery for Paul Kemp Hairdressing.

## Day One: Observing the Experts

Nervous but excited, David and Eve stepped into the studio ready to learn. Day one was all about observing Hooker and Young demonstrate what goes into an editorial shoot.

From prepping their models to styling the final looks, the duo showed how to build volume, glamour and movement into hair that translates perfectly on camera. It was an invaluable chance for David and Eve to see first-hand how quickly and confidently top stylists work under pressure, while still keeping an eye on the smallest of details.

## Day Two: Going Hands-On

Day two was when it was their turn to shine. With their model, Enya, and a full creative team of makeup artists, stylists, and photographers on hand, David and Eve created two stunning looks...

To add movement for the shoot, David even got to bring out a leaf blower, which created that dramatic, high-fashion flow to the hair — and provided plenty of laughs behind the scenes. Between that and Eve covered in clips to keep every section perfect, it was a busy but unforgettable day.

Seeing Anya step in front of the camera wearing their hair creations was a proud moment for both David and Eve. The final images felt bang on brand for Paul Kemp Hairdressing, polished, modern and full of glamorous energy.

The images are yet to be displayed in the salon, but both stylists are excited to share them with the team and clients.

David and Eve came away from the workshop with more than just new imagery, they gained confidence, speed and a taste of what it takes to work at an editorial level.

They both say they’d love to do it all again, perhaps exploring even bolder, more fashion-forward looks next time. And with this experience under their belts, they’re ready to bring that elevated styling back to the salon floor.
