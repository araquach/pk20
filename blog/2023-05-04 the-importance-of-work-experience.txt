Left to right: Ellisia, Grace, Jasmine, Kristen + Brooke!

These guy's are kick starting their career whilst still in school, out on all of our sites supporting our busy teams and soaking up knowledge from our experts. 

It's so important for students to get some work experience under their belt whilst they are still in education.  It can make you stand out from the crowd when applying for courses, training and jobs. Not to mention the opportunity it gives you to mature, grow in self-confidence and self-understanding.

Here at PK we love supporting that growth and absolutely buzz off seeing young people thrive.  If these guy's love it, they will be moving onto our apprenticeship scheme later this year and will start building up their very own client base.

Be sure to say 'hey' if you spot them at the weekends!
