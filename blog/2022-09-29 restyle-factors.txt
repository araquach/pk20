Are you considering taking the jump and restyling your hair? A restyle is a really fun way to change up your look and bring life to your hair without using colour. And we don't mean a basic trim, we mean changing the shape, texture, adding in layers, going from long to short or even shaving half your head off! If so, there are couple things you might want to consider in advance:

# Do You Really Want a New Look?
First things first. Ask yourself, do I really want a new look? You need to be sure before you sit in the chair that you're ready change up your style. Consider it carefully and even get friends and families opinions on your current hairstyle compared to the one you intend to get. 

# Face Shape
When choosing the best hairstyle for you, face shape is one of the most important factors to consider. Work out what face shape you have. There are 5 general shapes - oval, round, square, diamond, heart and forehead. Your haircut can either accentuate and flatter your features. Or do the opposite, depending on whether the style you've chosen suits your face shape. 

Ask your stylist if you are unsure - they know the best looks to compliment your features and have you looking your best. 

# Texture
Considering the hair's texture before a restyle can often be overlooked, when in fact it plays a massive part in the finished result of a haircut. The basic textures are, straight, curly, wavy and kinky curly. No haircut will change the texture of your hair, so it's best to work with what you've got and get the cut that corresponds best with the texture you have. 

# Lifestyle
We need our hair to compliment our lifestyle. If you have minimal time in the morning to get ready before work, having a hairstyle that requires you to style it for it to look good, can  be working against you. Also, get a cut that suits your personality! Are you a little eccentric? Show that in your hairstyle!

# Trends
Whether its fashion, hair or makeup, most of have been guilty of hopping on a trend. As we know, trends come and go, so before getting that hairstyle you've seen everywhere, consider if it's right for you. Hairstyles you see celebrities wearing suit their face shape and personality so it doesn't necessarily mean that's what is going to look great on you. Instead, maybe go for looks that are more timeless. 

If you're into a trendy hairstyle, just remember to get it because you like it, not just because it's what's cool at the moment. 

# Consultation 
Get a consultation booked with your stylist to get their expert opinion. Just make sure you turn up well prepared, with your hair in it's natural state, washed, and bring along any pictures of the haircuts you're considering. Remember to ask questions about the maintenance of the style you go for as this can make the difference between loving and hating your hair.
