It’s 2022 and it’s that time again to grab your glitter and dance around in a field listening to your favourite artists! Each year when festival season comes around we expect to see a few different trends popping up, and this year is no different. You’ve probably seen the Y2K trends taking over the fashion and beauty industry again, and it’s no surprise it’s filtered into festival fashion this year. To help you get inspired for summer, we found the best hairstyles to come out of Coachella. From effortless water waves, to long braided ponytails, there's something for everyone.

## WATER WAVES

A new take on mermaid waves, but with a more relaxed, free-flowing and textured finish. Meant to look as if you've stepped out of the ocean and left your hair to take its natural shape. You can create these waves using a flat iron, taking 2 inch section and working your way down the hair in and S-shape. Finish it off with some texturing spray and some hair oil on the ends for some shine.

## BUTTERFLY CLIPS

Bringing the 90's back with butterfly clips has been a really popular style at Coachella this year, as seen on celebs like Olivia Rodrigo and ... The clips provide a pop of a colour to your hair, while keeping fly aways at bay. Either clip them randomly to your hair or add them into your ponytails, braids or buns. 

## SPACE BUNS

These are one of the go-to hairstyles, year after year for festivals. It's so versatile and works with any hair texture and it's the perfect style to keep your hair out of your face while you're dancing away in the sun. It's also super easy to do, you could either go for the full space buns, incorporating all your hair, or the half-up half-down look depending on how you feel. 

## HAIR GEMS

Do you love to sparkle at festivals? Why not go all out with gems and take them beyond your eyes, and into your hair. There are no rules when it comes to glitter and gems and there's nothing wrong with looking like a walking disco ball!

## BRAIDS

Braids are a festival go-to trend, so it's no surprise to see them make a comeback this year at Coachella. Braids are easy to style and can elevate any hairstyle. What's more, they work great to keep frizz at bay and hair out of your face when your amidst large crowds. Another great thing about braids is you can be as creative as you like with them. Hailey Bieber opted for boho waves with a few baby-braids added throughout the hair and we're living for it. Or if your after a completely different look, like a slick-back pony, why not add in a braid for some extra fun. 

## BUBBLE BRAIDS

Nodding back to the 00's, these braids are a funky way to elevate any look at a festival. Once again, bubble braids are so versatile and can be styled in various ways - such as in a high or low pony or pigtail, mini face-framing braids or in a french plait. They keep your hair out of your face and are really easy to do, so why not give these a try for your next festival.
