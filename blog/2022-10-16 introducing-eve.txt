We're excited to announce the arrival of our latest team member - Eve Simpson.

Eve has completed her training at our Academy (**Base Hairdressing**) and has now progressed to a Graduate Stylist role here in **PK**!

Eve is no stranger to the salon as she worked alongside the team as part of her time as an apprentice, sharing her time between **Base, Jakata and PK**. She absorbed all her knowledge from the inspirational stylists she's worked with and is now putting her creative talent and flair to good use here at PK!

She's going to be working full time in the salon and is eager to build on her growing client base, this is the perfect platform for her to continue to grow. If she carries on at this rate of development she could be one of the busiest stylists in the salon in no time at all!

***Good luck Eve - we know you'll do amazing here at PK!***

If you want Eve to work her magic on **you** then book in for a free consultation with her on 01925 444488 - or you can use our online booking.
