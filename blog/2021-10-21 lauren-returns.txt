Base Hairdressing is our sister salon training academy for up and coming stylists. Its doors opened back in 2019 and has managed to build up to a team of 7 new apprentices. One of the stylists who played a key role in getting Base to where it is today is Graduate Stylist, Lauren Watson. 

Lauren began her hairdressing journey with us at Paul Kemp Hairdressing, shortly before Base had opened. She really enjoyed her time there, learning from a group of extremely talented hairstylists. However, as Base is a training academy, we felt it would be the best place for her to develop her skills. At Base, staff are always on hand to help and train you to be the best you can be. You are also surrounded by other like-minded individuals who are in the same boat as you. This is great when you are learning so you can bounce ideas and give advice to one another.

Now Lauren has returned to PK, she is enjoying being back with her old team. She's also managed to build up a number of regular clients and is looking to continue to grow her client base.
