As a part of the SKP Collective team, I was invited to be a part of London Fashion Week with Schwarzkopf Professional UK. I was a part of Spring Summer 2023 in September 2023, working as a part of a hair team backstage for Malan Bretten with lead stylist Philip Haug.

This was **my very first fashion week experience**, and it was eye-opening to everything that goes into putting on a captivating runway show. As someone who has not had a huge knowledge of the high fashion side of the industry but wants to learn, this first experience was incredible. We mainly used the **Osis range** and created a **half-up half-down volume look**, which gave a modern sixties vibe. I learned how to work with a group of stylists and work under some time pressures, which is an **invaluable skill** to learn when doing any form of backstage work.

The second show I worked on for that season was backstage for the designer **Kay Kwok**, working under lead stylist **Nick Urwin**. This was with the **Schwarzkopf Pro global team**. For this look, it was more **futuristic and avant-garde** to go with the style of the clothes. The products used were from the **Session Label** line. We enhanced the natural texture and then created a little flat, highly glossed gel square in the hair, reminiscent of a barcode style. Something subtle but requiring **extreme skill and precision** to get right. Again, I learned **incredible skills** on this show.

I was extremely fortunate enough to be invited back for Autumn Winter 23/24 for my second season assisting under lead stylist **Philip Haug**.

The first show we worked on was for the designer **Helen Anthony**. With this being my second season, I felt a bit more prepared and was excited to be a part of the amazing team again. For this show, we used **Session Label and Osis**. To complement the clothes, we simply enhanced the natural texture but kept the hair off the face. The hair was kept behind the shoulders to really show off the beautiful models, and we kept the overall silhouette of the hair quite flat to the head, as I noticed the undone natural texture was a recurring trend this season in high fashion spaces.

The second show for this season was for the designer **Frolov**, with lead stylist **Philip Haug**. The clothes for this show were very sexy and a little more grungy, and the hair reflected this story. Using mainly mousses, we created very textured, tousled looks. We aimed for an **undone and grungy look**, so we used mousse and hair dryers to create this. 

With models with fringes, we created a swooped messy fringe that sat over the face with a loose ponytail. Again, the vibe was moody, and the hair really translated that. Sometimes, the techniques that require fewer products and tools are harder to create because less is more in this case, and as a hairstylist, this can sometimes be hard to get right.

Throughout my experiences working backstage at **fashion week**, I have learned so many skills on runway hair and doing hair for shows. These skills are **invaluable to me as a stylist** with a passion for working backstage and for photoshoots. Many of these new skills I have brought to the salon and to my clients, incorporating them into my training sessions for my juniors. 

The main thing when it comes to hair for shows, runways, or photoshoots is prep. Prepping the hair beforehand determines how the look is going to turn out, and using the right products is key. I am incredibly grateful to have been given these opportunities, and I hope this won't be my last blog post about **London Fashion Week**, and I will be attending more in the future.
