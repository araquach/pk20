In celebration of Schwarzkopf Professional's 50th Essential Looks, they have brought to us the new INSCAPE collection in collaboration with IGORA ROYAL and inspired by PANTONE. The collection is inspired by escaping the outside world into a rich inner life.  
 
The INSCAPE collection sees a natural partnership in colour; PANTONE is the world-renowned colour expect, shaping the shades that encapsulate every moment and IGORA ROYAL is the brand for professional colourists with innovative formulations that empower hairdressers to be the colourist they want to be in any situation.

“In the global trend calendar colour predictions come before anything else and you see them emerging everywhere – from interiors to the runway. The PANTONE Colour Institute is there at the very beginning of the process – so it was really inspiring for the whole team to create with them.”
International Creative Director for Schwarzkopf Professional, Simon Ellis (@thesimonellis)

6 looks across 3 key trends have been created out of the collection which are:

**Trend 1**: Novel Comfort – is all about texture, softness and cocooning

**Trend 2**: Quintessential – offers a playful modern twist on retro

**Trend 3**: E-phoria – celebrates futurism and a re-energised human connection

The expert colourists behind the exciting collection are Schwarzkopf Professional’s Global Ambassador Lesley Jennison and Schwarzkopf Professional’s Global Colour Ambassador Arjan Bevers, as well as the creative experimentalists X-presion. All passionate about showing stylists how the latest colour trends can be used to create contemporary looks on everyday salon clients.

This trend is all about creating soft feminine looks that reflect self-love and acceptance within your ‘cosy cave’. The palette consists of earthy colours, multi-textural, effortless cuts to represent that feel-good feeling.

The Quintessential trend direction takes you on a journey back to 1960's femininity. Infusing soft nostalgia with a new modernity. Joyful floral hues are centred around ash greys and cendré hues that are brought to life through precision techniques, contemporary cuts, rounded styling and of course... a perfect finish.

It’s a new dawn, it’s a new day and E-phoria celebrates a blended world as humanity is introduced into the world of technology to build a better future. Extravagant and bold elemental reds meet glowing metallic shades, with cuts to highlight the individual and styling for self-expressionists.
