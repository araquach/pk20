# Dramatic Fringes
Fringes have been around forever, but this season, they seem to be having a major revival. Varying from wispy layered curtain bangs to dramatic micro bangs, which celebs like Bella Hadid and Emma Watson have been seen sporting. If you've been thinking about getting bangs then don't hesitate to go as wild as you like (now is the time to do so).

# Bobs
The bob - been around for over 100 years and not going any where any time soon. Whether it be a Lob (long bob), shoulder-grazing, choppy style or blunt, it's so versatile that you can choose the right style to fit your personality. 
If want to it to look more modern, then you can add colour, textures and layers and bring it down to shoulder-length to give it a rock n roll vibe.

# Shaggy Shoulder Cut
The shaggy haircuts are back! Not only are celebrities going for this style but any woman who wants to look modern and trendy. The basis of this cut is lots of layering and you can go as crazy with it as you like. For a softer approach have the ends feathered out, or to add more drama go for spiky ends for the (I've just got out of bed look).

# Curtain Bangs
A super trendy and simple way to vamp up your hairdo. This cut is great for framing the face and also if you'd like to take it to the next level, add in some highlights or colours.

# Lux Hair
This style is all about embracing the hairs natural texture, whether it be curly or straight. In order to keep the hairs natural mirror-like shine, it's important to focus on the overall strength and health of the hair through using less dyes, chemicals and heat.

# Buzz Cuts #
If you're the low-maintenance type then look no further than the buzz cut. Confidence is key when rocking a hairstyle like this and most women need to be prepared for any remarks they may get. People will be jealous they don't have the confidence to pull it off like you!

# Raw Textures and Rough Layers
According to experts in the industry, the biggest trend for the colder months comes in the form of texture and rough layers. The choppy pieces give the hair movement and embracing the hairs natural texture reduces the need for heat styling thus leading to healthier hair. This style can come in many forms, from the wolf cut and mullet to the french-girl bob.

# Copper Hues
This hair colour never fails to show up as the colder months come around. For good reason it is one of the most popular hair colours of the season. You can as big and bold as you like, opting for more vibrant tones. If you want something a bit more subtle, we recommend going for darker hues.

# The Modern Mullet
The mullet is well and truly back, it's been revitalised since the days of 80s bikers and has now taken on a more modern edge. We understand this haircut isn't for everyone, however if you are ballsy enough, then go for it! Especially if you're wanting to stray away from the "pretty-girl" look.

# Flippy Layers
This nostalgic hairstyle takes us back to the early 2000s era. It's all about the layers to give the hair plenty of volume and bounce. Order this up at the salon and you'll find it so much easier to mock the look of a fresh, bouncy blowout.
