Schwarzkopf Professional have revamped their iconic professional styling range - SESSION LABEL. Consisting of 12 innovative, high performance products, designed to empower every stylist in their creations.

## SESSION LABEL
The new and improved range has been formulated to meet the demands of hairdressers who use products on set or in salon every day. There is a product for every style and finish within this collection, therefore no limitations in what you can create. 

Along with the new formulas, is new packing which has taken a modern/minimalist approach. Great for a stylist on set wanting to take some behind the scenes shots, without having intrusive products in the background.

## The Products
SESSION LABEL has relaunched 7 of their most-loved products from the previous line and introduced 5 BRAND NEW products. Schwarzkopf have ensured all of the plastic resin is carbon-free to ensure recyclability and 10 out of 12 of the products contain vegan formulas, making this their most empowering styling range.

“Understanding how to use product and styling tools is the key to successful session styling. Mastering the rules and techniques with product knowledge then allows you to break them, this will take your work to a whole different level and give you the confidence to create endless results.”

–	Schwarzkopf Professional Global Styling Ambassador, Nick Irwin
