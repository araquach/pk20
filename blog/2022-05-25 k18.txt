Revolutionary hair products are rarely released - the main one you can probably think of is Olaplex, released in 2015. After 10 years of research in biosciences, K18 have released a miracle treatment - the K18Peptide™ Molecular Repair Treatment!

It isn’t your typical haircare brand that sells shampoo's, conditioners and masks to give you temporary results. K18 actually works to repair damage to the hair at the deepest molecular level. Giving you back the look and feeling of strong, healthy hair. 

## What is K18?
K18 is made up of their special K18Peptide™, which travels into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains). The K18Peptide™ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains. Once inside the hair cortex, the unique amino-acid chain goes directly to the broken disulphide bonds to replace the lost amino acids, regenerating the bond and restoring ultimate strength, resilience and softness.

It can undo damage caused by chemical services, thermal styling, mechanical styling and environmental damage, and to see the best results - use it progressively over time.

## The in-salon treatment
This professional treatment is done in two-stages. First, the professional Molecular Repair Hair Mist is used pre-service on slightly damp hair, and is made to strengthen the hair before being chemically treated. One of the great things about this mist is how easy it is to use for stylists. With such a fast application method (spray and leave for 4 minutes), it means the treatment barely eats into the time you have with your client and it saves 20 odd minutes of their time. Once the mist has processed for 4 minutes, your stylist will continue with the chemical service. 

The second part of the treatment is the Professional Molecular Repair Hair Mask. This is applied to the hair after the chemical process, once the hair has been shampooed (not conditioned), and then towel-dried. It should be left in for 4 minutes, with no need to rinse out, and then styled as desired. 

## The take-home mask
The K18 take-home mask is a lightweight formula applied and should be applied to freshly shampooed, towel-dried hair. This is a leave-in mask, so it mustn't be rinsed out! Wait for 4 minutes before adding any other products or styling. It's available for purchase in our salon. For best results, use 3-4 times every time you wash and then every 3-4 washes for maintenance.

## Who should us it?
Everyone. It can be used on any hair type to restore elasticity and strength, even if you don't colour your hair.
