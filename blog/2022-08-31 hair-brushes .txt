Chances are, most people probably haven't given much thought into the type of hairbrush they use - they more than likely popped into to Boots one day and just grabbed the first one they saw. The amount of different types of brushes out there can be overwhelming and how are you supposed to know which one to go for?! 

Keep reading if you'd like to learn what the best type of brush is for your hair and some tips for when to use each one...

## 1. Detangling Brush
Designed for detangling in the shower, this brush is great for any hair type, especially those with unruly hair. This type of brush won't pull, tug or snag your wet or dry hair.

## 2. Vented Brush
The vents in these types of brushes aid in speeding up your drying time, as the heat from the hair dryer can reach all angles of the hair strand. This means less time for drying and less heat on your hair! Just make sure your hair is 80% dry before using the brush.

## Paddle Brush 
The paddle brush has a wide base, so allows you to brush your hair quickly, while smoothing the hair. A great choice of brush if you have long, straight hair.

## Curved Brush 
Not as common as other brush types, this brush is ideal for drying hair faster and is great for distributing yours hair's oils from scalp to ends.

## Round Brush 
The round brush is the perfect brush to create a big, bouncy blowout. They come in many different sizes, therefore using a smaller brush will create a tighter curl, and a looser curl using a larger brush.

## Teasing Brush 
It comes as no surprise that this brush is used for teasing. If you want to add a little volume to an up-do or purposely create little knots then this is the brush to use. But don't be to harsh with this one, or tease your hair too often as this can cause breakage.

## Shower Bush
Specifically designed for wet hair, this brush has bristles as stiff as a comb, so it won't pull at your hair as much a paddle brush.

## Cushion Brush 
Is your hair prone to getting static of frizzy? If so, this could be the brush for you. The nylon pins and rubber pad combat this and smooth the hair.

## Thermal Brush
These can be round or paddle brushes. The barrel in the centre made of a material that conducts heat, such as ceramic, tourmaline, or titanium. This helps to speed up drying time and are great for those who frequently use a blow-dryer.

## Afro Comb
The afro comb has wide teeth so that it can lift up and out tight curls without damaging the hair. Often used to create the afro hairstyle.

## Natural Bristle Brush
For vegans or anyone who wants the benefits of a boar bristle brush without using animal products, some brushes combine other natural fibres, like agave, with synthetics to achieve a bristle that looks and feels like boar bristle.

## Smoothing Brush 
Smoothing brushes are paddle brushes with soft boar or nylon bristles. Perfect for creating sleek hairstyles and eliminating bumps while pulling the hair back into a ponytail.

## Mixed-bristle Brush 
Mixed bristle brushes combine the shine-enhancing effects of boar bristles with the scalp stimulation and easy detangling of nylon or wire bristles. This combination can be most effective for those with long or thick hair.

## Straightening Brush
Straightening brushes are a mix between a hair straightener and a paddle brush. Once heated up they can straighten and smooth your hair quickly, causing less damage than a traditional straightener. 

## Wide-toothed Comb
Wide tooth combs, as hinted at by their name, have thicker teeth  and this is to allow larger amounts of hair through. This should be a preferred choice for those with thick, curly, or tangled hair. If you're coming out of the shower or your hair is otherwise damp or wet, a wide tooth comb is the only way to go.

# What are the benefits of brushing your hair?
There are more benefits to brushing your hair than simply taking out knots. Brushing distributes oils through your hair, stimulates hair growth and helps to remove any loose hairs. 

Just remember to keep your hair brush clean, donâ€™t over-do the brushing, or be to harsh while brushing damp/wet hair - as this can cause the hair to lose it's elasticity and snap. 

There are so many brushes on the market to choose from, so don't think that you now need to buy all of them. Just keep in mind what brush best suits your hair texture and and the goal you want to achieve - reduce frizz, add shine or detangling. 

If you are unsure about what hairbrush is best suited for your hair type, don't hesitate to ask your stylist at your next appointment - they will be more than happy to help!
