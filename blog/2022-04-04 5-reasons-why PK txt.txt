There are a few benefits on why you should take a trip to the salon. The obvious one being - needing a trim. But there a couple other reasons you may not have thought of. Some see going to the salon as a chore, whereas others might see it as an experience. Listed below are some of the benefits.

## 1. Variety of Quality Services
Hair stylists will provide all your hair necessities like cuts, and colours, scalp and Keratin treatments. Or if you have an occasion coming up and you just want it styled, then they offer that too. Salons are basically one stop shops for all your hair needs. 

## 2. Expertise
The services you get when visiting a salon are rendered by professionals, who have trained and studied in their area for years. They stay on top of techniques and processes that keep you looking great and also ensure your hair is healthy. Additionally, many hair salons require their employees to continue their education, so they are up-to-date on beauty and wellness standards, products, equipment, and techniques.

In our salons we offer continuous training for all our stylists, to allow them to become the best stylists they can be. Our graduate program gives individuals with no experience, the opportunity to work their way up our graduate program to become Advanced Senior Stylists.

## 3. Stress Relief
Scheduling a hair appointment ensures a bit of pampering just for you. It gives you a break from your routine and the stresses of work and life. Even a quick trim offers relaxation and much-needed downtime. If you're in the mood for a chat, or you need to have a little rant, your hairdresser will be more than happy to have a laugh or be there there just to listen. Or if you would like a quiet, relaxing experience they can also do that for you. 

## 4. Professional Products
We only like to offer the best products to our clients, which is why stock the following professional brands:
- Schwarzkopf Professional
- KEVIN.MURPHY
- OLAPLEX
- ghd

It's no coincidence why your hair feels and looks so good after a trip to the salon. The ingredients in professional products cause less damage to your hair and scalp, helps your colour treated hair to last longer in between salon visits, and better treats and protects your hair from heat and chemical damage.

## 5. Appearance Boost
Sometimes the best thing to help your mood is a new look. Stylists can help you find a fresh style or revitalise your current one. These experts will offer professional advice on the best colours or styles for you, and they can suggest a great idea you may not have stumbled upon on your own.
