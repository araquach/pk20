Like standing in dog poo, getting ghosted or stubbing your toe, split ends are an unfortunate thing that most of us deal with at some point. And when that strand split's it's game over, you can't repair it like a false nail and they will need to be chopped off. So we are here to tell you that prevention is better than cure and are sharing our top tips.  But before we dive in let's first understand breakage a little better... 

Hair breakage is when your hair shaft breaks. Leaving you with split ends and shorter hair strands. This is usually because your hair is suffering from dryness and damage, largely as a result of mishandling your hair.  There are a few ways we mistreat our hair but heat is the number one culprit when it comes to breakage.  Once breakage hits the ends of your hair and you attack it with a hot styling tool your hair is more vulnerable to damage. That damage then travels up your hair quicker than before, pulling all the moisture from it. Your natural oils get stripped out and the water molecules evaporate. It actually changes the structure of your hairs keratin strands, it stretches them which can cause your hair to become stringy and porous. It kills the shine and fades your colour, resulting in thinner, more broken and you guessed it, duller hair!

It's worth noting that hair breakage is not the same as hair loss. It’s very normal to lose 50-100 strands of hair a day but one way to tell if your hair is breaking is to check out the ends of your hair. If they’re shorter than the length of your hair, have frayed, split ends and feel dry, it’s likely breakage and you will benefit from implementing the hacks below to prevent it spreading further. 

1. Use Protection
You wouldn't dream of picking up a baking try from the oven without a mitt would you? No. And this is a great example of why you shouldn't leave heat protection out of your styling routine.   Just like the oven mitt, heat protection acts as a barrier between the heat and your hair. This is our most vital tip as it quite simply prevents the burning of the hair by shielding your hair with a protective layer. We recommend applying GHD bodyguard before you blow dry for maximum protection. Spritz over damp locks from root to tip and comb through to make sure it is evenly distributed. Then heat and style as normal at no more than 185 degrees. Using this also creates a smoother, sleeker finish for shiner hair!

2. Shield from the sun
Don't just use heat protection before you use your hair dryer or straighteners, use it in the sun too! Just like applying suncream on holiday you need to show your hair some love and shield it from those glorious but powerful rays.

3. Watch the temperature
If you think that heat styling tools with temperature settings an unnecessary feature, thank again! If you use the wrong temperature setting for your hair your breakage is going to get much worse. This is true for all heat styling tools, straighteners, hot brushes, wands etc...The density and texture of your hair will determine the kind of heat you should be using. For example, thin hair would be suited to the lowest of temperatures whilst more coarse hair could be tackled with something higher. GHD tools only go up to 185 degrees so these are a great option when it comes to protecting your hair, next time you are in the salon get your stylist's input on what settings or tools you should be using for the least amount of damage for your hair type.  

4.Regular haircuts
Another staple tip is ensuring you are having regular haircuts.  Visiting the salon for a trim at least every 6 weeks is one of the best ways to prevent split ends and reduce further damage.

5. Limit your hair wash days
This is a simple one, the less you wash your hair the less you will need to apply heat in order to dry it. Another reason to reduce your wash days is because shampooing too much can also strip your hair of moisture leading to more dryness. Plus, how much effort is washing your hair anyway? You might worry or be more prone to grease but you can try avoiding hot water when you shower to see if that helps. Not only can the hot water dry out your hair and scalp it triggers your sebaceous glands to produce more sebum, which is a natural moisturiser. 

6. Find a sleep hairstyle
Going to bed with wet hair is a big no no. This can cause breakage because the hair is so fragile when wet, it becomes more elastic and prone to breakage in this state. But even when it is dry, we suggest following your hair care routine and going to bed with your hair styled in a protective way. Either a classic plait or loose bun. This is because with every toss and turn, you're creating friction between strands, making it hard for your hair to live its lushest life. You could also treat yourself and invest in a silk pillowcase. The fibres of silk are smoother than cotton and they will cause less friction on your hair. 

7. Blot and squeeze 
Remember point 5? Wet hair is fragile! So if you are still towel drying your hair, by rubbing it vigorously between the towel please stop.  Ever noticed how your hairstylist gently blots and pats your hair when you get up from the backwash? That's not just to give you a pleasant experience its intentional, blotting and squeezing the hair using a microfibre towel is ideal so not to cause breakage and frizz.

8. Stop over-brushing 
Stop taking that brush out in your bag and only brush your hair to style it. Be sure to gently comb through knots without yanking and pulling on your hair as much as possible, especially in its fragile state of being wet. A helpful bonus tip here is to brush your hair when it's dry before your shower to tease out any tangles.

9. Extensions
If you have heat damaged hair and have a lot of breakage, extensions could be a great option for you as you set out on a path to recovery.  When used correctly they are a great way to let your hair repair without compromising on your long mane. You must still apply all the tips above but by adding replaceable hair, you can ensure that the majority of heat styling is applied to that hair as opposed to your own. This will allow your natural locks a little bit of downtime. If this appeals to you ask your stylist next time you are in the salon to run through the best options on extensions.  

10. Try a treatment
We have a range of treatments available in the salon that you can purchase and use between visits to help combat the stresses of everyday life on your hair. 

- K18
- Olapex
- Fibre Clinix
- BC Repair Rescue Sealed Ends

Your stylist can discuss these options to see which would be best suited to your hair.

11. Hair dusting
There are also varying techniques of hair dusting which is a process that removes split ends without removing any of the hair length. It's done by snipping the bottom of each strand to eliminate the damaged hair tip. Each stylist will have their own approach on this but it is worth exploring to see if this is a good option for you. 

12. Take care from the inside out
Nutrition plays an integral part in promoting healthy hair in conjunction with all the previous tips. It is essential to consume a balanced diet that contains plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, protein (hair is made up of protein after all), vitamin D, iron and zinc. Ensuring your intake of all these will lead to  stronger hair and a healthier you!
