Meet Kam — a passionate and hardworking apprentice with an infectious, sunny vibe that lights up any room. His friends describe him as spontaneous, chatty, and outgoing, qualities that perfectly complement his love for creating unforgettable moments. Born in the winter months, Kam carries that warm, summer-loving energy, often found immersed in festivals and thriving on social connections.

At Base, Kam dives headfirst into his exciting journey as an apprentice, immersing himself in meeting diverse personalities and taking on thrilling colour and cutting projects. But his passion for hairdressing began long before joining our team. As a kid, styling captured his heart, starting with his beloved hairdressing doll and blossoming into becoming the go-to hairstylist during golden time at school.

Kam's signature style? The iconic 90’s blowout — a fusion of volume, elegance, and chicness that turns heads effortlessly. While his accolades might be in the making, his biggest achievement—a six-hour colour correction session on his best friend—stands as a testament to his dedication and love for his craft, leaving his friend feeling like a million bucks.

What truly drives Kam is his commitment to ensuring clients leave our salon ten times happier with their hair than when they arrived. Quality over quantity is his mantra, ensuring every client’s hair is in impeccable condition.

Beyond the salon, Kam is a connoisseur of creating memories, indulging in travel, hitting up festivals, and crafting killer cocktails. Yet, even if he weren’t getting paid for it, wielding styling tools and perfecting his craft would still be his passion.

For those seeking a stylist with a unique flair or looking for someone friendly to bring out the best in their hair, Kam is here to turn those hair dreams into a reality. His ultimate goal? To make waves as a celebrity or runway stylist, but until then, he’ll keep perfecting those blowouts and spreading joy wherever he goes.
