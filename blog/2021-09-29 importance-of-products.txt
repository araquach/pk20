At Paul Kemp Hairdressing we understand how important it is to use the right hair care products for your individual hair type and texture. The correct product can not only make a difference in how you look but how you feel! Who wouldn't want *healthy*, *thick*, *glossy* hair with minimum effort!

## Why do stylists recommend you use professional products?

Your stylist will have years of experience in using a variety of products and will have built up the knowledge on what works and what doesn't. There is a reason behind behind why after you've paid a visit to the salon, your curly hair feels *silky* and *frizz-free* and your dry hair feels *moisturised*. It's because they have applied the correct shampoos, conditioners, styling prep and lotions for your hair to achieve its optimum texture.

Supermarket bought haircare brands can often leave build up on the scalp. This is due to them containing too many *sulphates*, which strip the hair and scalp of its natural oils. **They can also strip the fresh colour you've just had done, which is the last thing you want!**
