Anyone else just love the feeling of a fresh haircut? When you run your fingers through your hair and can't feel those pesky split ends. I sure do! This type of hair damage is caused by physical or environmental damage to end of the hair strand, leading it to crack and split. 

Unfortunately, split ends are inevitable unless you often get trims and use moisture treatments regularly. However, there are ways in that you can prevent the ends of your hair splitting prematurely, which we are going to cover in this blog. 

If you're finding the ends of your hair split quite quickly after a hair cut, or you notice that most of the ends of your hair are pretty damaged, listed below are some of the reasons that might be causing your hair to split.

# Using Too Much Heat
Split ends appear when the hair has become dry and brittle. Over exposure to heat will dry out the hair creating the perfect environment to cause broken ends. Using heat on your hair over 180 degrees will affect the moldability and the keratin, which impacts, strength, texture and shine in your hair. Therefore, don't forget the heat protectant and remember to turn down the temperature in shower and on your styling tools and limit sun-exposure. 

# You're Chemically Treating Or Colouring Your Hair Too Often
It can be fun using dyes to change up your hair colour or using chemicals to change the texture, however it does come at a cost. The chemicals used in these hair treatments suck out the natural  oils, making the hair dryer. The follicle can get weakened, leading to unhealthy hair growth, increasing the chance chance of split ends. To prevent this happening, your stylist should use a pre-treatment to protect the hair before a chemical service. You should also avoid booking appointments too close together and use haircare products that are rich in moisture. 

# Over-Washing 
It's recommended to wash your hair 2-3 times per week. If you are washing your hair every day or every other day then this could be a cause of your split ends. Washing your hair too often  strips the hair of its natural oils and dries it out, also using water that is too hot or cold will not help. Try washing your hair with lukewarm water twice a week to keep the split ends at bay. 

# Brushing Your Hair Wrong
Hair is most fragile when wet, so using the right brush to get those knots out is so important. Combing your hair with either a wide-tooth comb or wet brush will enable you to detangle your hair more smoothly without ripping your hair out. The best technique to brushing/combing is to start at the ends and work your way up to roots to prevent tangles. 

# Picking Your Split Ends 
We've all been there when you can't help just picking the split ends off! You think it might be helping but you're really just causing further damaging and giving yourself more ends to pick in the future. Try to avoid the temptation get booked in for regular trims. 

# Not Having Regular Hair Cuts 
If you're trying to grow your hair out, you might think it's counter productive to get a haircut. When in actual fact it will help you hair to grow quicker. Leaving your hair un-trimmed for more than three months will increase your chances of split ends appearing. Once the end splits, it works its way higher and higher up the hair strand to the point where it will break off. So by not cutting your hair, it is actually getting shorter!
