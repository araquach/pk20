Have you been invited to a wedding this year and started to think about how youâ€™ll wear your hair? We've had the exact same thoughts! Not only do you have to think about your outfit, makeup and accessories, but your hair as well and it can be stressful. 

While still being mindful to not to out-shine the bride on her big day, but want to make an effort. We've put together a few ideas that are suitable for a variety of hair types, wedding locations and personal styles, so there's something for everyone.  

## SLEEK PONYTAIL
This hairdo is one of the most versatile and can be worn by anyone. With the right amount of hair gel or hairspray you can be sure that your hair is staying put all day. That's why it's so great for weddings, no matter the time of year, day or night, your hair will look clean and polished. You can change up the parting (middle parts are very popular right now).Or, you can even elevate your sleek ponytail by adding a braid, accessories or hair extensions to give it that WOW factor!

## SIMPLE AND ELEGANT
This look is just some soft waves, which can be created using a curling wand or hair straighteners on most hair lengths. For a more put-together vibe, curl each strand in the same direction to create an effortless flow through the hair. If your wanting something a bit more undone, alternate the direction you curl each strand. This style is more reserved than others, which is why it's a great option for a wedding no matter how formal the occasion. It looks fabulous on almost all hair types and is fairly simple to achieve.

## NATURAL CURLS
If you have naturally curly hair, why not embrace the natural beauty you have and save yourself all that time stying your hair? Just dry your curls with a diffuser, and apply your favourite hair products to keep the curls in place and you'll be ready to go in no time!

## GLAM HOLLYWOOD WAVES
This is a timeless, classic wedding hairstyle, typically paired with a side-part and a bold red lip, like seen on the red carpet. You can achieve this look using a curling wand, ensuring the strands are going in the same direction and make sure to tuck one side behind your ear, and don't forgot the extract volume.

## MERMAID WAVES
Is the wedding you're invited to in a sunny destination? This style can look beautiful for a beach wedding and if you can't be the bride, be a mermaid princess! All you need to  achieve this style is either a curling wand, hair straighteners or mermaid waver. We suggest using clip-in extensions to add more length and volume and once the hair has been curled, comb it through and add some hair oil to avoid frizz and add shine.

## WISPY BUN
Think Hailey Bieber's wedding hair for this one! Another popular hairstyle for wedding guests, as it keeps your hair out of the way all day and always seems to look effortless. Firstly, create some soft curls through your hair and tie it together in a middle-part, low bun. Add in some clip-ins if you want some extra volume. Pull out the front pieces to frame the face, or keep it all tucked away, depending on your preference.

## VOLUMINOUS LOW PONYTAIL
A hairstyle that can be worn on numerous hair types and looks amazing curly/afro hair. Start with slicking the hair down in a low ponytail. Next, curl the rest of your hair and don't be scared to add as much volume as you want! Like Tiffany Haddish, you can even add an extra long extension to really create some drama.

## HALF-UP HALF-DOWN
There are so many variations you can create with a half-up half-down do, therefore you'll definitely be able to find a variation that suits your look.  
Keep it light, with a few soft waves added to the hair or you could go the opposite way, channeling Ariana Grande's signature style - slicked back, high pony, leaving out the front section  and blowing out the ends. You can even add bedazzled clips or a bow to really elevate the glam.
