Taking the plunge and getting hair extensions can be a big decision! We're here to help you decide if hair extensions are the right option for you. 

In the this blog post, we'll highlight the main reasons why getting hair extensions are a great option for more than just the obvious reasons (length + volume)! However, we would advise you against having hair extensions if any of the following relates to you:

- You've recently experienced a lot of hair loss
- Your hair is shorter than 6 inches
- You plan on keeping your hair tied up most of the time
- You frequently change up your hair colour
- You've had chemotherapy or cancer treatment within the last year
- You wash your hair every day and/or regularly go swimming

Below are the following reasons why hair extensions could be an option for you:

# 1. LENGTH

### HAIR GROWTH

Starting with the obvious reason - length. Do you ever think to yourself: "Why won't my hair grow past a certain point?" We understand why some of you might get frustrated with your hair, because you've been doing everything you're supposed to for your hair to grow, but it just won't. If this sounds like an issue you're facing and want a simple solution, we can give you those long, luscious locks you've been wanting in a matter of minutes. 

### HAIRCUT REGRET

Most of have at least one horror story from a hair appointment, where you've gone in asking for a trim off the ends and left with choppy mullet. Hair extensions are a great solution for fixing a messed up hair cut. 

# 2. COLOUR

Afraid to get your hair coloured because you don't want to cause  damage to your hair? Or you're afraid the colour might look bad? Hair extensions are a great option for adding highlights/lowlights to your hair without causing damage. You can even play around with different colours and tones to see what suits you best, without the long-term commitment. If you're not happy with the results, there's no need to worry because it's not your hair any way!

# 3. Volume

### HAIR LOSS

We understand if you are suffering from hair loss or thinning hair, it can be a real knock to your confidence. Hair extensions  can bring back that volume and thickness you've lost and restore your confidence. We're here to help you feel comfortable in your skin again!

### FROM THIN TO THICK

Even if your hair isn't too thin, but you still want that extra "oomph" you can still try out some extensions to achieve that dramatic, voluminous look (you can never have too much hair). 

# 4. Style

### CHANGE UP YOUR LOOK

When it comes to styling, adding in those extra inches can really elevate your look. Turn your simple ponytail into a long braid and create styles that might not be as achievable with shorter/thinner hair. You could even add a clip-in fringe to take your look to the next level, with zero commitment!  

### ACCESSORIZE

Another great way to use hair extensions is using them as an accessory. For example, a braided head-band - perfect for a summer festival. You can achieve this by adding a clip in extension with maybe a pop of colour, or just plait your existing weft extension. 

### SPECIAL OCCASIONS

If you fancy spicing up your hair for a big birthday bash, wedding or graduation or any occasion really! Extensions are a great way to do this. With having thicker, longer hair your options for different hair styles are endless. So those gorgeous long mermaid waves you've had saved on your Pinterest board can actually be achievable!

# 5. NO DAMAGE

Some say hair extensions damage your hair,  but that is only if they are not maintained properly and fitted and removed by a professional. Avoid keeping them in past the time frame you're supposed to, as this can cause breakage, because your hair will be under tension for too long. Another way to avoid damage is ensuring your extensions aren't too heavy for your hair, and you are taking care of them as recommended by a professional. Also, always be gentle with your hair, whether you have extensions in or not - not too much tugging or heat.

The best thing about hair extensions is that they give you so much freedom to be creative with your hair, and nothing is permanent so there's no need to worry!

## Important points
- if your hair is oily or unwashed for too long all fitting methods will slip and will not last as long. 
- if you change lifestyle such as start swimming/go to the gym more often this will affect the longevity of the fitting and hair.
- if you have any change in medication or health this may affect the life of the fitting.
- if your tape starts to twist or spin you will be due a refit. You may need to move your appointments earlier
- any extension application will affect hair colour choice and the length of your appointment on each visit.

## Caring for the hair
We recommend always using salon professional shampoo and conditioner recommended by your stylist. It is important to keep the hair extensions hydrated with moisture based shampoos and conditioner as it is not attached to a scalp therefore does not get the same nourishment as your own natural hair. This will maximise the life of the extensions. 
We advise to keep conditioners and oils away from the root where bonds are fitted to avoid them slipping out over time. A weekly or fortnightly intense hair mask on the ends of the extensions will also keep the hair feeling smooth and hydrated for longer. Always use heat protection on the extensions and your own hair if you plan on using heat tools.

## Caring for your own hair
It is important to not pull on the extensions too much or have your hair tied up for too long, this will strain on your own hair that is in the beads/tape. Typically you use less heat on your own hair however still using professional shampoos and conditioners (in areas where possible) is advised. 

## Right Tools to Use
Using the right tools is important to avoid damage to your own hair and also keep the extensions looking healthy and natural. The first tool you need is a soft bristle extension brush. Your stylist can show you exactly what one looks like. We recommend to blow dry the ends with a large paddle brush and you can still use a round brush to finish of at the ends
but be extremely careful not to get this near the roots and it will pull hair from the beads/tape. 
You always need a nozzle on your hair dryer when blow drying and aim this from root to tip to avoid any hair being roughed up at the root area. 
You can still use all your normal heat tools to style. 

## Sleep routine
To keep your hair in the best condition we advise sleeping with your hair under low tension. Loose plaits, low back or side pony using a scrunchie. We don't advise you to sleep with your hair down as this will rough up the hair as you sleep. 
To go the extra mile you can sleep on a silk pillowcase to avoid your hair being knotty in the morning and keeping the extensions smoother.
Never sleep with your hair wet as will cause more friction and cause your hair to matt quicker and cause breakage, the extensions can also cause scalp irritation if not dried.

## Fitting and Re fitting process 
All time recommendations can vary due to many factors such as, how quickly your hair grows, how oily your natural hair gets, lifestyle and maintenance.

## Micro/Nano Rings
We normally take around 45mins to apply one pack of hair. Then extra time for cutting and styling where necessary. We need to fit the extensions on freshly washed hair with no conditioner to minimise any oils getting in and around the beads. You can do this yourself at home ahead of your appointment or we can do this in the salon for an extra cost.

We recommend a 2-3 Months window before re fitting is needed. On average people lose 100 hairs a day, therefore at the 3 months the extensions are attached to around half the hair they were originally fitted to. This will cause damage to your own hair if left any longer. 

To refit we remove all the extensions. If the hair has not been cared for properly this process will taker much longer to de tangle the hair and will cost more for the time of removal.

## Caring for the hair around the beads
If you're having individual extensions for thickness and not length we normally leave a little gap between each bead. It's important to use a soft extensions brush and go through each section twice a day to ensure this hair doesn't matt together. 
If your having extensions for length and thickness we will place most of them next to each other however it's still important to brush twice a day, after a few weeks grow out the beads can matt together if not cared for properly and could lead to damage to your own hair and also costing more to remove them when you come back for a re fit.

## Micro Weft
A micro weft can take up to 30 mins to fit per row plus additional time for cutting and styling. Typically we wouldn't fit more than 3 rows into the hair. We need to fit this onto freshly washed hair with no conditioner to minimise any oils getting in and around the beads. You can do this yourself at home ahead of your appointment or we can do this in salon for an extra cost. We advise 6-10 weeks in the hair due to the added weight and natural hair loss. To refit we remove the weft, take out the beads and comb through and refit in a slightly different place to reduce strain on your hair

## Tape Extensions
Tape extensions only take around 15mins for 5 sandwiches of hair. We need to fit this onto freshly washed hair with no conditioner to minimise any oils getting onto the tape. You can do this yourself at home ahead of your appointment or we can do this in salon for an extra cost. We recommend no more than 6-8 Weeks for a refit of tape as they can slip down and be difficult to style your own hair plus the natural hair loss over this time would mean the tape is held on my hair far less then when originally fitted. 
To refit we remove the tape with a solution, comb out any left behind tape and refit in a slightly different place than before to reduce strain on your hair and scalp.
