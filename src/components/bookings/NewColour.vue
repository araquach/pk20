    <p class="is-size-4 has-text-danger">Important info - please read...</p>
    <p class="is-size-5">Before we carry out a colour service on new clients we do a full consultation in advance of your booking to
      determine the time required and to ensure we're all on the same page before we proceed. We do the obligatory skin
      test too at this time (which has to be done 48 hrs before we can colour your hair). We will then get you booked in
      and also take a deposit to secure the booking.</p>
    <p>When you proceed to the booking page please book in for your consultation from here, or you can book in for a
      Cut, Dry & Style or Blow Dry where we have even more time to discuss your colour needs!</p>
    <p class="has-text-danger"><em>Please do not try and book a colour as we will not be able to carry out the service without the
      pre-consultation and skin test - the booking will be cancelled out.</em></p>
    <p>If you're unsure, please call the salon during opening hours on 01925 444488</p>
