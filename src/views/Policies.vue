          <h2 class="title is-3">Deposit, No-Show & Cancellation Policy</h2>
          <p>To secure your booking, we require a deposit for all new client services, revitalise treatments, or
            appointments lasting over 60 minutes.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This deposit must be paid by card at the time of booking.</li>
            <li>The deposit will be deducted from your total bill on the day of your service.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Card storage is powered by Stripe, who have the very highest security and Level 1 PCI Compliance.
            Neither staff,
            nor Phorest staff will have access to the raw card details at any stage.</strong></p>
          <p>Phorest uses tokenisation, which means that when you save your card details, the system doesn't store the
            actual credit card number. Instead, it generates a unique token that represents your card.
            Cancellations or changes within 48 hours of your appointment may result in the full amount being charged to
            the card on file.</p>
          <p>If you cancel your appointment entirely before the 48 Hour period, your deposit will be <strong>retained as
            credit</strong>, which you can use in
            <strong>any of our three salons</strong> at a later date.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2 class="title is-3">Late Arrival Policy</h2>
          <p>We understand that things happen! However, arriving late for your appointment can affect your service and
            the clients booked after you.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>For longer services:</strong> Being <strong>15 minutes late</strong> is considered too late.

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are running late, please call us as soon as possible so we can try our best to accommodate you.</p>
          <p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you arrive late, we will try to complete your service in the remaining time.</li>
            <li>If only a <strong>smaller service</strong> can be provided due to lateness, you will still be <strong>charged
              for the
              original service booked</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>If you are too late for us to carry out your service, it will be treated as a <strong>no-show</strong>,
              and our
              <strong>no-show policy will apply</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>This policy helps us respect the time of all clients and keep the salon running smoothly. Thank you for
