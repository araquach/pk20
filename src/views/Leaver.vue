          <p class="is-size-4">As a loyal clienty of Abi's we wanted to let you know that she has decided to move on from the PK team.</p>
          <p>After spending 6 years working in the salon she has made a decision to move away from hairdressing and try something new.</p>
          <p>The team wishes her luck in her new career and we'll all miss her. Her final day in the salon is Saturday 15th October.</p>
          <p>If you have an appointment booked with Abi, one of our team will be in touch soon to discuss the options.</p>
          <p>We have a whole host of amazing stylists in the salon and we're introducing a brand new team member too. Eve has recently worked her way up the ranks from our Base Academy and has a similar approach to Abi.</p>
          <p>Lauren is another great option</p>
          <p>Brad</p>
          <p>Don't overlook some of the stylists at our other amazing salon Jakata! Both Lauren Thompson and Abbi Green are at a similar level to Abi and would love to look after you hair needs!</p>
