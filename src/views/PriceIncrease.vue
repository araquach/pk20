          <p class="is-size-4">From your next appointment, there will be a small price adjustment. This is due to recent increases in the minimum wage, employer National Insurance contributions, and the rising cost of stock and energy prices.</p>
          <p>We want to continue offering the same amazing service you’re used to. We’re also committed to training and developing the next generation of talented stylists, ensuring our high standards continue long into the future.</p>
          <p>We truly value our loyal clients and want to be as fair as possible while ensuring the long-term health of the business. It’s always a fine balance, and we’re so grateful for your understanding.</p>
          <p><em>Please remember, we offer a range of stylists to suit different budgets, so there are options for
            everyone!</em></p>
          <p class="is-size-4">Your continued support means the world to us and keeps our salon running – thank you, sincerely. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to get in touch.</p>
