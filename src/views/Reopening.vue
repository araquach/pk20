        <p><strong>It's been a long time coming but we're happy to say we're finally back open!</strong></p>
        <p>We've had a full on two days of non-stop colouring and cutting with the whole team on form, doing what they love best!</p>
        <p>We're loving catching up with all of our clients after so long and getting stuck into some major re-styles! Never seen so much hair dropping to the floor ðŸ˜‚.</p>
        <p>The salon remains a COVID safe space and we're doing our best to keep it that way.</p>
        <p>Our phone lines are remaining off for a week or two until we catch up - we're pretty much booked up until May now with only the odd gap for cut and blows and mens cuts.</p>
        <p class="is-size-5">If you need to get in touch please leave a message on our voicemail or message us through Facebook messenger and we'll get back as soon as we possibly can.</p>

        <p>Again, please be patient for a response as the whole team are flat out for the next few weeks.</p>
        <p><strong>Don't forget to use our skin test questionnaire to see if you need an update before your colour</strong></p>
