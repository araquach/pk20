        <h2 class="subtitle is-3">For a full refit and rebrand</h2>
        <p class="is-size-4"><strong>The Paul Kemp Hairdressing premises will be temporarily closed from 23rd December 2025 until 5th March 2026 for a full refit
          and rebrand.</strong></p>
        <p class="is-size-5">We’re taking this time to rebuild the space, upgrade the experience and come back with something that feels fresh, modern and completely new - along with a brand new salon name!</p>
        <h2 class="title is-3">Where your appointment will take place</h2>
        <p class="is-size-5">To keep everything running smoothly, your stylist will be working from one of our sister salons during the refurbishment.</p>
        <p class="is-size-5"><strong>If your appointment is with:</strong><br>
          <strong>Izzy / Shell / Kellie / Jo</strong> <br>
          Your appointment will take place at:<br>
          <strong>Jakata Salon, 27 Rylands Street, Warrington, WA1 1EJ</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5"><strong>If your appointment is with:</strong><br>
          <strong>David / Eve / Lauren / Becky</strong> <br>
          Your appointment will take place at:<br>
          <strong>Base Hairdressing, First Floor 90/92 Bridge Street, Warrington, WA1 2RF</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5"><strong>The PK phone lines and booking system will be diverted to these sites during this time so everything
          remains the same - all you have to do is come to the salon your stylist is at.</strong></p>
        <h2 class="title is-3">Payment Info</h2>
        <p class="is-size-5">During the temporary closure, all payments will be <strong>card-only</strong>. No cash can be accepted at Base or Jakata while we’re working from these locations.</p>
        <p class="is-size-5"><em>We’re really sorry for any inconvenience this causes, and we genuinely appreciate your patience and
        flexibility while we make these improvements to the salon.</em></p>
        <h2 class="title is-3">Thank you for your patience during this time...</h2>
        <p class="is-size-5">We know this is a change in routine, but it’s going to be worth it!</p>
        <p class="is-size-5">The new Paul Kemp Hairdressing space is being redesigned from the ground up, better workflow for stylists, better comfort for clients and a more beautiful environment for everyone.</p>
        <p class="is-size-4">We can’t wait to welcome you back through the doors once the refit is complete!</p>
