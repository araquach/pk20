So friendly and catty and just a gorgeous warm person. He clearly knows his stuff, as he was able to advise me about my scalp and haircut shaping. 
The downside was only the price. ¬£55 for a blowout ‚Ä¶ to be fair the website said ‚Äúfrom ¬£25‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt actually ask beforehand (so I paid without objections! I‚Äôm not a Karen!) but I just don‚Äôt think I can stretch to this again. Maybe the special scalp shampoo and fringe trim I asked for added to the cost and I didn‚Äôt realise‚Ä¶? Not sure.
