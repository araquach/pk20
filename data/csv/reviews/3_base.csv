"""I came here because it was recommended. I shown J the picture of the haircut I want doing. Where as he got the fringe and the top perfect, he went did something I did not ask for. He did the 2 back and sides but for some unknown reason took all the hair off, right to the very skin, around my ears. It looks horrible, and is very noticeable from a distance. I have to walk around looking like this now and it makes me very insecure. The worst bit, I can‚Äôt go back and ask them to correct it. The only way to correct is to have all hair off back and sides. I am now worried that the hair around my ears will never be the same length as that as back and sides. I just don‚Äôt understand why he did this or why he felt he needed to do this. For the attention of the owner, please just follow the instructions of the customer. Don‚Äôt think using your imagination makes it better.

"""Fantastic experience all round. I felt like I was in very good hands throughout and I especially liked how careful and concise Sarah was. Even though she explained she hadn‚Äôt been with the company for very long I felt as if she was very talented and professional.

I massively appreciated Jimmy being there and his expertise in explaining what his and Sarah‚Äôs vision was for the cut.  

I will definitely be recommending Sarah and Jimmy to my friends and family

It‚Äôs one of the best haircuts I‚Äôve had in years and I can‚Äôt wait to see Sarah again. 

Thanks guys""",,,,,,
