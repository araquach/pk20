"""Lauren was incredible as always! She was extremely patient and lovely with my mum who has Alzheimer's Disease and hasn't had a haircut in many years. My mum cannot stop playing with her hair and showing everyone she sees. She is so proud of how much of a beautiful job Lauren did on her hair.

My mum went from shy and reserved to super confident in an hour.
I cannot recommend Lauren enough, she is outstanding and I will not hesitate to bring my mum back to her. Lauren made my mum comfortable, talked through everything with her very clearly and made it a very stress-free experience for both myself and my mum. 
Thankyou again Lauren!""",,,,,,
