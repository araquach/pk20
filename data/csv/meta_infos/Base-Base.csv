3,beth,Meet Beth,"Hiya, I’m Beth.  I've been hairdressing for almost 2 years now and have been working in the hair industry for nearly 3 years. Originally I didn’t consider becoming a hair stylist, that was until I got a Saturday job in a hair salon and since that day there’s nothing I’ve wanted to do more...",beth-profile
3,sophie,Meet Sophie,"Hi, I'm Sophie and I've been hairdressing for around 3 years now. I started when I had just left school back in 2016, up until 2 years later when I decided I wanted to try something different. I never knew what it was I really wanted to do with my life. After college, 2 jobs, nothing was the same. I knew that I needed something more. Hairdressing is the only thing that has made me feel satisfied that I am actually making a difference in peoples lives. I love the feeling of making someone smile as hair is such a big thing in everyone's lives. I saw Base's advert during my job search and I knew it was the place for me.. somewhere that was willing to assess where we are at already within our careers and taking the time to push us to be the best we can be. I just love how confident they are in us, as soon as I walked in for my interview I got a good vibe.",sophie-profile
