lucy,Meet Lucy,"Hi, I’m Lucy I have been hairdressing for nearly three years now. I decided to go into the hair industry because I have always loved plaiting and playing with my sisters hair, also it was something I was looking into and really caught my attention in my last year of school.",lucy-profile,3
lauren,Meet Lauren,"Hi, I'm Lauren. I've been hairdressing for almost 3 years now. I always considered doing hairdressing as a career since being a child as I have always found interest in experimenting with styling friends and family members hair! I knew hairdressing would be the right thing for me to Dao as a career as I enjoyed it so much.",lauren-profile,3
beth,Meet Beth,"Hiya, I’m Beth.  I've been hairdressing for almost 2 years now and have been working in the hair industry for nearly 3 years. Originally I didn’t consider becoming a hair stylist, that was until I got a Saturday job in a hair salon and since that day there’s nothing I’ve wanted to do more...",beth-profile,3
sophie,Meet Sophie,"Hi, I'm Sophie and I've been hairdressing for around 3 years now. I started when I had just left school back in 2016, up until 2 years later when I decided I wanted to try something different. I never knew what it was I really wanted to do with my life. After college, 2 jobs, nothing was the same. I knew that I needed something more. Hairdressing is the only thing that has made me feel satisfied that I am actually making a difference in peoples lives. I love the feeling of making someone smile as hair is such a big thing in everyone's lives. I saw Base's advert during my job search and I knew it was the place for me.. somewhere that was willing to assess where we are at already within our careers and taking the time to push us to be the best we can be. I just love how confident they are in us, as soon as I walked in for my interview I got a good vibe.",sophie-profile,3
ruby,Meet Ruby,"Hi, I am Ruby and I began hairdressing in November 2019 - so I still have much more to learn on my journey to becoming a stylist yet I have loved every moment along the way. As a child I always had a passion for hair and beauty, beginning with styling my two older sisters hair with plaiting and braiding, not to mention chopping off the hair of my Barbie dolls with the kitchen scissors!",ruby-profile,3
